But one piece of the interior had some people scratching their heads. While it looks fun and futuristic, the usability of the yoke style steering wheel was immediately questioned. The missing top of the wheel allows a much more open view of the road and instrument cluster, while also giving the car a more open feeling. And many agree it looks great as well. But how easily would one be able to drive without having the top part of the wheel there, especially after knowing nothing but a fully round wheel? The Tesla owner in the video below (starting around 26:24) seems to really enjoy the yoke, and the steering and use look very natural. \"One hand driving's also not a problem,\" says the owner. He goes on to say it's really comfortable, and says he's used to it now after an initial break-in period. Benzinga's Take: Like many things Tesla, the yoke is radically different from other production vehicles. The Model 3 and Y lack any type of instrument cluster in front of the wheel, only offering a center screen. When first using the car, these features can be intimidating, but as seen in the video above, it takes just a small amount of time, and people can enjoy and even prefer the distinct changes Tesla makes.

(TSLA) seems to have nearly sold out the Model Y Long Range variant in Q3 based on recent registration figures, as per Teslarati. Shares rose 1.3% to close at $617.69 on June 14. The earliest possible delivery date for the Model Y Long Range variant has been extended to September, which is the end of the company\u2019s third quarter of FY2021. Tesla\u2019s all-electric crossover Model Y has already proven to be more popular than the all-electric Model 3 sedan in markets such as China and California. (See Tesla stock analysis on TipRanks) The overwhelming demand for the Model Y has led to a price hike of $3,500 so far this year, despite the company cutting the cost of the car considerably in February. Tesla has also made several alterations to the Model Y this year, including removing a lumbar-support option in the passenger\u2019s seat and the removal of radar equipment in both the Model Y and Model 3, as a means to progress towards the company\u2019s Full Self-Driving ambitions. During the company\u2019s Q1 2021 Earnings Call, CEO Elon Musk said, \u201cWhen it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world and probably next year\u2026 I\u2019d say more likely than not, that in 2022, Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world.\u201d With the company already selling out of its Q2 production volumes in early May, Tesla has been on a rampage, trying to scale up manufacturing capabilities for all of its vehicles, with Model Y being the prime focus as it expands geographically. Yesterday, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $820, implying 32.8% upside potential to current levels. In his latest Global EV report, Rakesh stated, \u201cWe believe TSLA remains the battery electric vehicle (BEV) market share leader globally, with ~24% market share\u2026While we expect to see emerging competition for TSLA in the coming quarters with the VW ID.4, Mercedes EQS, and Mustang Mach-E, (among others), we would note the complexity and investment required to successfully ramp and integrate battery technology and new EV platforms.\u201d The stock has a Hold consensus rating based on 9 Buys, 6 Holds, and 7 Sells. The TSLA average analyst price target of $620.70 implies that shares are almost fully valued at current levels.

Andreas Scheuer told German newspaper Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung there were some technical issues to resolve but he expects to reach a solution, adding the goal was to make sure consumers can access charging stations across brands with a single payment system, ideally via smartphones. \"I am in direct talks with carmakers such as Tesla to make sure the existing infrastructure, for example Tesla's Superchargers, will be open to other manufacturers,\" he was quoted saying. Tesla currently operates more than 1,000 charging spots in Germany. Expanding the infrastructure necessary to drive mass adoption of electric vehicle has been a challenge in Germany, with various carmakers and utilities launching separate initiatives. In total, Germany has about 40,000 public charging spots currently, according to energy industry group BDEW.

Investors who have bought and held this stock over the past decade have seen absolutely insane returns. The question of whether Tesla has grown to a size that doesn\u2019t make sense anymore is a topic of conversation for many investors. At this point, the company has been valued at just shy of $600 billion. (See Tesla stock analysis on TipRanks) For investors on the fence with Tesla, it pays to be aware of some bearish catalysts facing Tesla stock right now. Tesla Stock Could be In For Some Pain There are several pertinent bearish catalysts about which Tesla investors could be cautious. For one, broadly speaking, EV stocks have been hit by inflation-induced bond yield increases in recent months. Indeed, all growth stocks have this headwind to contend with at the moment. Additionally, as has been known for awhile, a global EV chip shortage is threatening production numbers for all high-growth EV players such as Tesla. Moreover, earnings quality has become a big issue for investors. The fact that Tesla\u2019s still losing a ton of money making electric vehicles, yet is able to report a profit due to unsustainable cash flow streams (namely, Bitcoin trading and the sale of emissions credits), is worrisome to many long-term investors. Also, valuation concerns have begun to take hold with Tesla stock. This stock still trades at more than 16 times sales and 600 times earnings. As mentioned above, those earnings primarily comprise non-operating profits. One of the most famous investors of our time, Michael Burry, who is known for his role in The Big Short, has placed an absolutely massive short bet on Tesla. His recently-filed form 13-F spells out an incredible short, the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen in a long time. Obviously, Burry is not predicting continued growth for Tesla. Another worry concerns Chinese orders for Tesla vehicles, which were nearly cut in half last month. This comes as U.S.-China tensions ramp up. China is the largest global market for electric vehicles, accounting for approximately one half of the global EV market. Thus, Tesla\u2019s key growth engine appears to be revving down considerably. Finally, the intense level of competition in the global EV market is heating up in an incredible fashion. Competitors are producing more EVs at better price points than Tesla. Their EVs offer technological improvements and product enhancements that close the rather large gap Tesla had in this regard not too long ago. How Much Weight Should Investors Give These Catalysts? Investors in Tesla may still argue that there are reasons to own Tesla stock. Among the key reasons to be bullish on Tesla are Gigafactory projects in Berlin and Texas. Tesla believers are hopeful these projects will be able to potentially increase production capacity by as much as 500% overall. However, given global chip shortage issues and the rise of competitive forces and nationalistic endeavors from key markets such as China, the global sales outlook for Tesla may simply not be as bright as many Tesla investors may want to believe. Producing cars is fantastic. However, it\u2019s unclear whether Tesla will see the kind of sales numbers materialize in a few years\u2019 time when more players hit the market and aggressively compete for the growing market Tesla has (mostly) had all to itself for quite some time. Additionally, CEO Elon Musk has continued to promise full self driving technology and robotaxis for years. While these have yet to materialize, one Chinese company Baidu (BIDU) has already launched a fully autonomous robotaxi service in Beijing. Accordingly, this is a technological race it appears Elon Musk\u2019s team has lost. What Analysts Are Saying About TSLA Stock According to TipRanks\u2019 analyst rating consensus, TSLA stock comes in as a Hold. Out of 23 analyst ratings, there are 10 Buy recommendations, 7 Hold recommendations, and 6 Sell recommendations. As for price targets, the average analyst price target is $639.81, with a potential upside of 4.9%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $67.00 per share to a high of $1,080.00 per share. Bottom Line Tesla is a mega-cap company for a reason. This company\u2019s brand and passionate CEO are the reasons most investors continue to hold on to these shares. However, given other recent catalysts bearish to the Tesla discussion, there may be more downside on the horizon. Investors should always be reminded that trees don\u2019t grow all the way to the sky. When stocks get this large, growth tends to slow. It is wise for investors to remain cautious about placing outlandish growth expectations on companies valued as highly as Tesla. At some point, the valuation stops making sense.

However, some German environmental groups are uncomfortable with the project and seek to halt the construction work, according to a Reuters report. Tesla is constructing the gigafactory near Berlin in Germany\u2019s Brandenburg state. Brandenburg\u2019s environmental authority granted the company a provisional permit for the construction. (See Tesla stock analysis on TipRanks) But environmental groups Gruene Liga and NABU have objected to that permit. The groups are concerned that the gigafactory will produce highly poisonous gas. They say Tesla has not sufficiently clarified the measures it will take to prevent the gas from escaping from the plant. Additionally, the groups say Tesla has not obtained the necessary permit to produce battery cells at the facility. The groups want state authorities to file for a suspension of Tesla\u2019s gigafactory permit by June 16, or else they will go to court. Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney recently reiterated a Buy rating on Tesla stock with a price target of $860. The analyst\u2019s price target implies 41% upside potential. Delaney reiterated the bullish rating after Tesla began deliveries of the Model S Plaid, the advanced version of the Model S. The car can accelerate from 0 to 60 MPH in less than two seconds, with Tesla saying it is the world\u2019s fastest-accelerating production car. \"While the market for the Plaid itself is relatively small, we believe it is an important product,\u201d noted Delaney. Consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 10 Buys, 7 Holds, and 6 Sells. The Tesla average analyst price target of $632.10 implies 3.64% upside potential to current levels. According to TipRanks\u2019 Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool, confidence in TSLA is currently Positive.

Tesla redefined electric cars in 2012 when it launched its high-end Model S with a sleek design and long driving range, and Chief Executive Elon Musk said the new version was designed for a future where cars drove themselves. \"This car crushes,\" Musk said at an evening delivery event held at Tesla's U.S. factory in Fremont, California. \"It's like, man, this is, just, sustainable energy cars can be the fastest cars, be the safest cars, gonna be the most kick-ass cars in every way.\" Musk's irreverent attitude and speeches peppered with engineering terms, have given him a star power he uses to draw attention to the brand, allowing Tesla to avoid advertising. The model is \"faster than any Porsche, safer than any Volvo,\" said Musk, wearing a black leather jacket, after he drove the Model S Plaid down a test track onto the stage. He said he expects to produce 1,000 a week next quarter. Ahead of the event, Tesla raised the price by $10,000 to $129,990 against $79,990 for a long-range Model S. \"The Model S has not been changing a lot in terms of looks over the past almost decade,\" said Jessica Caldwell, executive director at car information provider Edmunds. \"I think Tesla has to offer consumers something more ... like new and fun things.\" The launch of the Model S Plaid, which has already been showcased online, has faced delay and some controversy over an expected airplane-style yoke steering wheel. Musk canceled another variant, Model S Plaid+, which would have had a 33% higher driving range than the Model S Plaid and used advanced battery technology, known as 4680 cells. \"The Model S Plaid is definitely intended to help reduce the migration of current Tesla owners out of Tesla,\" said Ed Kim, vice president at consultancy AutoPacific. \"I think what we're seeing now is that Tesla can no longer operate in a vacuum.\" He said Model S Plaid is a low-volume, halo model aimed at showcasing the automaker and generating excitement around the sedan, with Tesla needing to successfully roll out new models like Cybertruck and Semi trucks to expand its customer base. Musk has called the Model S Plaid \"the fastest accelerating car ever.\" The more powerful sports sedan goes from zero to 60 miles per hour (97 kph) in 1.99 seconds and has an estimated driving range of 390 miles (627.6 km). While it offers little change in body style, the Plaid charges faster at Tesla supercharger stations, has a roomier back seat and an improved entertainment system, including what he said was the \"level of a PlayStation five.\" \"If we're thinking about the future where the car is often in autopilot to full self driving mode, then entertainment is going to become increasingly important. So you're going to want to watch movies, play games, use the internet...\" Tesla delivered only 2,020 Model S/Xs in the first quarter, down from 18,920 the previous quarter, hampered by production delays. Musk said in April that production of its new Model S and X would be \"contingent on global supply chain issues.\" Tesla shares rose 1.9% on Thursday ahead of the evening event.

However, in the past six months, the stock has been largely sideways. After a correction from all-time highs of $900, TSLA stock seems to be in a zone of consolidation. Among the very optimistic commentators, Cathie Wood believes that Tesla stock can touch $3,000 by FY2025. It might seem difficult to talk about the long-term stock price outlook. At the same time, considering the industry tailwinds and several company specific factors, it seems very likely that Tesla stock will remain in an uptrend. The global electric vehicle industry is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 29% over the next ten years. Even if Tesla\u2019s growth is in line with the industry average, the company is positioned for strong upside in revenue and cash flows. (See Tesla stock analysis on TipRanks) Further, being an industry leader, it\u2019s very likely that Tesla\u2019s growth will exceed the industry average. Therefore, the long-term bullish case for Tesla stock still seems to be intact. Manufacturing Presence as a Trigger for Growth  One factor that\u2019s likely to help Tesla in boosting EBITDA margin and free cash flows is global manufacturing presence. In the United States, the company is building another manufacturing unit in Texas, in addition to its Fremont plant. The Texas facility is on track to commence production and delivery later this year. Additionally, Tesla\u2019s Shanghai Gigafactory is already operational, creating a gradual increase in quarterly production output. The company\u2019s Gigafactory in Europe is on track for production and deliveries in late 2021. With manufacturing in multiple locations, logistics cost is likely to decline. Further, as production ramps up, operating leverage will boost EBITDA margin. Tesla also plans entry into India. It will not be surprising if the company sets up another manufacturing facility in India. The country is still at an early stage of electric vehicle adoption and is likely to be another big market for Tesla over the next decade. Strong Numbers and Strong Products TSLA stock is increasingly attractive from a financial perspective. For Q1 2021, the company reported cash and equivalents of $17.1 billion. In addition, the company\u2019s free cash flow for the quarter was $293 million. This implies an annualized free cash flow of $1.2 billion. With strong growth and the possibility of EBITDA margin improvement, the company is well positioned to increase free cash flows. The key point is that Tesla is unlikely to see any dilution in the coming years. Furthermore, the company is positioned to de-leverage. With strong financial flexibility, the product line-up and investment in innovation are likely to be robust. In terms of the product pipeline, it\u2019s likely that Cybertruck will open for commercial delivery later this year or early next year. Further, Elon Musk expects limited production of Model Y this year and production ramp-up in FY2022. The launch of these models will ensure that vehicle deliveries remain strong. At the same time, Roadster and Tesla Semi are in the pipeline. Therefore, with an exciting product line-up, Tesla\u2019s cash flows are likely to accelerate in the coming years. Investment in innovation is also likely to yield results and ensure that Tesla remains ahead of the curve. In particular, the company\u2019s autopilot and full self-driving features are likely to be delivery volume game-changers. Wall Street\u2019s Take According to TipRanks\u2019 analyst consensus rating, TSLA stock comes in as a Hold with 10 Buy, 7 Hold and 6 Sell ratings assigned in the last three months. As for price targets, the average Tesla analyst price target is $639.81 per share, implying around 5.2% upside potential from current levels. Concluding Views If electric vehicle adoption continues to increase globally, Tesla has ample headroom for growth. With multiple manufacturing facilities, the company has the capacity to cater to incremental demand. Further, Tesla is a case of brand-pull more than brand-push. New markets like India will continue to support strong vehicle delivery. Overall, TSLA stock looks attractive at current levels with a medium to long-term investment horizon.

Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., a Tesla Inc. supplier, jumped as much as 8.6% in Shenzhen, taking its gains from a low in March to more than 50%.

Still, the move to 2.5-week highs above $39,000 has failed to calm market fears. That\u2019s evident from a chart pattern known as the \u201coptions smile,\u201d which shows relatively higher implied volatility or demand for options at strikes below bitcoin\u2019s current market price than the implied volatility for higher strikes options. The unique structure speaks of extreme fears and continued demand for downside hedges, as tweeted by trader and analyst Alex Kruger. In plain English, investors continue to buy puts in anticipation of a more profound price decline. Related: Market Wrap: Bitcoin Sustains &#8216;Musk Jump&#8217; as Crypto Sentiment Improves Options smile, a U-shaped graph resembling a smiley emoticon, is created by plotting implied volatilities against options at various strike prices expiring on the same date. Implied volatility is investors\u2019 expectations of price turbulence over a specific period. A higher implied volatility results from greater demand for options and vice versa. Options are hedging instruments that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option represents the right to buy and put the right to sell. Options smile for the June 15 and June 18 expiries charted by analytics platform Genesis Volatility is quite steep at strikes well below bitcoin\u2019s current price and relatively flat on the higher side. The subsequent expiries due on June 25, July 2 and July 30 exhibit similar structures. The steeper slope at lower strikes reflects fears of a sell-off and the flatter slope at the right end shows market participants expect rallies, if any, to be gradual. Related: Bitcoin and Ether Price Indicators Support Near-Term &#8216;Relief Rally&#8217; One may argue that the steeper slope at lower strikes could be stemming from increased demand for call options or bullish bets than for protective puts. However, put-call skews, which measure the cost of puts relative to calls, suggest otherwise. The one-week, one- and three-month put-call skews remain entrenched in the positive territory, implying stronger demand for short- and near-term puts. Had the market participants been buying in-the-money calls, or even higher strike (out-of-the-money) calls in large numbers, the put-call skews would have been negative. Deep-in-the-money calls \u2013 ones at strikes well below the spot \u2013 are relatively costly and eliminate the low risk-high reward advantage provided by calls at higher strikes. As such, in calls, hedging/trading activity is almost always concentrated at strikes just below the spot price, near the spot price and above the spot price, while in the case of puts, activity is mostly seen in strikes near and below the spot price. That seems to be the case with bitcoin as well. Data from dominant exchange Deribit tracked by the Swiss-based Laevitas platform shows a relatively high concentration of open interest (number of open positions) in out-of-the-money and at-the-money calls and lower strike puts. While the market remains cautious for the short term, the longer-term bias looks bullish. The volatility smile for the Dec. 31 expiry options carries a steep slope for higher strikes.

CEO Elon Musk\u2019s erratic comments about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies aren\u2019t helping the stock\u2019s performance because many institutions have taken positions in the last year and are looking for conservative accounting that just isn\u2019t possible, given high volatility in digital assets. In addition, the company is now a SP-500 component that\u2019s been public for more than a decade, forcing them to compete for capital with other blue chips, rather than at-home speculators. Wall Street consensus is mixed after last year\u2019s outsized share gains, with a \u2018Hold\u2019 rating based upon 15 \u2018Buy\u2019, 1 \u2018Overweight\u2019, 11 \u2018Hold\u2019, and 3 \u2018Underweight\u2019 recommendations. More importantly, 6 of 36 analysts covering Tesla recommend that shareholders close positions and move to the sidelines. Price targets currently range from a low of $67 to a Street-high $1,471 while the stock is set to open Monday\u2019s session more than $100 below the median $725 target. Tesla mounted the February 2020 high at 193.80 in June, entering a multiwave uptrend that topped out above 900 in January 2021. The stock then sold off to the 200-day moving average at 558.79, marking the first leg in a descending triangle that will post a second lower high if the current uptick reverses at or below 650. A test at the trading floor in the mid-500s could easily fail if that happens, yielding a breakdown that potentially sheds an additional 125 to 150 points.

These freshly-submitted public filings disclose money managers\u2019 equity positions as of the end of the three-month period that ended March 31st, so let\u2019s proceed with the discussion of the hedge fund sentiment on Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) worth your attention right now? Prominent investors were getting less bullish. The number of bullish hedge fund bets were cut by 6 recently. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was in 62 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of March. The all time high for this statistic is 68. Our calculations also showed that TSLA isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings). Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Hedge funds have more than $3.5 trillion in assets under management, so you can't expect their entire portfolios to beat the market by large margins. Our research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). So you can still find a lot of gems by following hedge funds' moves today. Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management At Insider Monkey we leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example, lithium mining is one of the fastest growing industries right now, so we are checking out stock pitches like this emerging lithium stock. We go through lists like the 10 best hydrogen fuel cell stocks to pick the next Tesla that will deliver a 10x return. Even though we recommend positions in only a tiny fraction of the companies we analyze, we check out as many stocks as we can. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. You can subscribe to our free daily newsletter on our homepage. Keeping this in mind let's check out the key hedge fund action regarding Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). At the end of March, a total of 62 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock, a change of -9% from one quarter earlier. On the other hand, there were a total of 61 hedge funds with a bullish position in TSLA a year ago. So, let's review which hedge funds were among the top holders of the stock and which hedge funds were making big moves. More specifically, Citadel Investment Group was the largest shareholder of Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), with a stake worth $16340.9 million reported as of the end of March. Trailing Citadel Investment Group was ARK Investment Management, which amassed a stake valued at $3864.3 million. PEAK6 Capital Management, Coatue Management, and D E Shaw were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Value Star Asset Management allocated the biggest weight to Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), around 29.58% of its 13F portfolio. Tao Capital is also relatively very bullish on the stock, designating 11.09 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to TSLA. Judging by the fact that Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has witnessed declining sentiment from the smart money, we can see that there is a sect of funds that slashed their entire stakes by the end of the first quarter. It's worth mentioning that Ben Levine, Andrew Manuel and Stefan Renold's LMR Partners sold off the biggest position of the \"upper crust\" of funds watched by Insider Monkey, comprising about $2056 million in stock, and D. E. Shaw's D E Shaw was right behind this move, as the fund dropped about $1654.4 million worth. These bearish behaviors are interesting, as total hedge fund interest was cut by 6 funds by the end of the first quarter. Let's now review hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). These stocks are Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Visa Inc (NYSE:V), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). This group of stocks' market valuations are closest to TSLA's market valuation.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 105.1 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $12984 million. That figure was $10013 million in TSLA's case. Visa Inc (NYSE:V) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is the least popular one with only 58 bullish hedge fund positions. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is not the least popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still below average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for TSLA is 28.2. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. This is a slightly negative signal and we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 17.2% in 2021 through June 11th and surpassed the market again by 3.3 percentage points. Unfortunately TSLA wasn't nearly as popular as these 5 stocks (hedge fund sentiment was quite bearish); TSLA investors were disappointed as the stock returned -8.7% since the end of March (through 6/11) and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential, you should check out the top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds as most of these stocks already outperformed the market in 2021.

The company said Monday that its existing 150,000-square-foot facility in Carson City, Nevada will also nearly triple in size. Redwood is adding another 400,000 square feet onto the Carson City recycling facility, which is expected to be operational by the end of the year. As part of its growth plans, Redwood is also hiring hundreds of workers. The company, which is backed by Amazon, employs 130 people today and expects to add more than 500 jobs over the next two years. Redwood's expansion announcement follows the Biden Administration's 100-day review of the U.S. supply chain and the release of a Department of Energy' document that lays out a plan to improve the domestic supply chain for lithium-based batteries. \"America has a clear opportunity to build back our domestic supply chain and manufacturing sectors, so we can capture the full benefits of an emerging $23 trillion global clean energy economy,\" Energy Secretary Jennifer M.

The company has a business-to-business strategy, recycling the scrap from battery cell production as well as consumer electronics like cell phone batteries, laptop computers, power tools, power banks, scooters and electric bicycles. Redwood collects the scrap from consumer electronics companies and battery cell manufacturers like Panasonic. It then processes these discarded goods, extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, and then supplies those back to Panasonic and other customers. The aim is to create a closed loop system that will ultimately help reduce the cost of batteries and offset the need for mining. Redwood Materials has a number of customers, and has only publicly disclosed that it is working with Panasonic, Amazon and AESC Envision in Tennessee Redwood Materials says it recovers about 95% to 98% of the elements from the batteries such as nickel, cobalt, lithium and copper. Today, it receives 3 gigawatt-hours annually, a figure that the company says is equivalent to about 45,000 cars.

CEO Moshe Cohen talks transforming New York City's iconic yellow cabs to Tesla Model Y taxis. - Moshe Cohen, he's the CEO of Gravity. And Moshe, I think all of us who live in New York City and even beyond are excited about something like this because you don't really think of New York City taxis as having the latest when it comes to tech. But tell us just about-- you launched this in the spring as a pilot program. How is it progressing? MOSHE COHEN: Yeah, so firstly, thank you for having me. It's great to be on with you guys. This is a first of EV fleets, not specifically Tesla. Tesla, as you know, has sort of been ahead of the curve with its development of cars and charging equipment. But very quickly, there's a lot of automakers that are catching up. We've seen the yellow taxi as an industry that has been a cornerstone of New York and of the country. And it's sort of had a bad 10 years. And there are a lot of great ideas that have been there, and it's a massive opportunity to integrate. MOSHE COHEN: What we've done is we've worked closely with the city, with the regulators, with the taxi and Limousine Commission and the commissioner to frankly help amend the rules. The rules that were written for internal combustion engines that were written around safety somehow preclude some very safe electric vehicles. So, it's been a process. It's sort of having the commissioner and the Taxi and Limousine Commission work with engineering and understanding what is that world look like with electric vehicles. And they've authorized a pilot, a broad pilot, for a broad group of vehicles of which Tesla Model Y is one. But we expect there to be others. - MOSHE, the one question that all New Yorkers ask this time of year with the taxis is does the AC work. I would assume in these vehicles, it does. But the potential for growth in these kinds of vehicles, it just seems like this is where it's going to head, yet regulations you just cited-- New York City, Chicago-- the cities are almost-- they protect the monopoly operators of the cab systems. How do you fight that? MOSHE COHEN: Well, we've actually not seen that. I mean, firstly to your first point, Adam-- these cars that we've operated a luxury business in the city serving the very top. And you always hope when you start with luxury to be able to bring most of that to the general public. And the technology that we're bringing in these vehicles, I would say would rival the highest level of luxury. Not only is there AC, but as you can see, there's a custom 22 inch monitor that's connected to the car. So you'll have full control over the car. You can see there the drivers have AR recognition to monitor their driving behavior, distraction, to induce for safety. So, these taxis are going to really leapfrog ahead in terms of safety. MOSHE COHEN: But to the second point, this is very different. I think five-ten years ago, it was very popular to be a disruptor, and everybody is disrupting. We're in a very different world right now with the introduction of electric vehicles. This is policy across the board, definitely with this administration and across the board with regulators. I think regulators are trying to get their head around it and make sure it's safe, make sure it's unleashed in the right way. But we've seen great cooperation. We work very closely with the utility, with state officials, with city officials. And it's really a partnership because this is a massive change to transportation and infrastructure. And it's going to happen working together. - Is the infrastructure, is it up to speed with what you need in order to have electric vehicle taxis on the road? MOSHE COHEN: Not at all. So, in fact, that's been a major block that's been overlooked. The taxi industry has gotten a lot of attention to parts of it. A big part of our business-- so, while this pilot was being considered, we have been infrastructure division gravity spaces where we worked again, in conjunction with the utility, major landlords, parking operators, to essentially activate every capable space for charging infrastructure, both for us and for the general public. And we are working currently on a very large number of sites, and we've sort of redefined what a charging space look like. MOSHE COHEN: So, right now, New York is a charging desert. It's disaster. But we're going from being a charging desert, we're going from the taxi industry being sort of embarrassing, to the taxi industry being a leader in the country and in the world, as it were integrated with the tourism agency, part of the green recovery. And in terms of infrastructure, we're literally at a turning point where the new equipment that we're launching across sites throughout the five Boroughs, for ourselves and for everyone, is going to give everyone, meaning any car manufacturer, an experience that's as good as the supercharger at Tesla, or better. - How do you deal with, you know, your industry-- the token issue, and then the drivers have to get the tokens. How did you guys confront that? MOSHE COHEN: So, the business structure of the taxi industry is extremely antiquated. I mean, I'm a former finance professor. You don't need that. Economics 101, it was very antiquated, and frankly it very much disadvantage the drivers. The drivers essentially are the core of revenue. The drivers have to pre-commit a certain amount of weekly fee to be able to drive one of these vehicles. And they're scrambling on their own to try to cover that and make a little bit more. And they've been pushed down to the bare, bare minimum. We're changing that structure. MOSHE COHEN: So, our innovation is essentially empowering drivers. It's empowering medallion owners through the use of our technology and in both hardware and software to make a lot more money and to be a lot more efficient. For example, our cars are connected. So, we're able to give direction to drivers to know where our pickups most likely, how are the cars going to get better utilized. There's just a host of technologies, both our own proprietary technologies and technologies that have been developed over the past five-ten years or so, that are dramatically changing the experience. MOSHE COHEN: And in fact, to the previous point, we're finding literally widespread friendliness. There's plenty of medallion owners that have had a rough time from dying prices. That's the problem. We're not speaking to that. We're not a medallion owner. There's a lot of medallions that are just sleeping right now that are not being used. And a lot of these medallion owners are just looking for an opportunity for the industry to come back the way it was in the 90s, when every single movie has a taxi. Being a taxi driver is a great job. And there's a lot of excitement around that. And so, we are essentially facilitating much higher earnings, much better working conditions for the drivers and the medallion owners.

JARED BLIKRE: I'll tell you what, the Tesla Model S Plaid is here, and it is blazing fast. And for that, I want to bring in our next guest. This is Oppenheimer Senior Research Assistant, Colin Rusch. And Colin, besides the blazing speed, does this car live up to the hype? Yeah, I mean, I think it does. They're trying to do a couple of things with this. One, update the Model S, but also really innovate on the technology side. We saw a couple of things with the RPMs on the motor running at blazing speed, and in the light weight. And that happened. So in terms of an evolution of the technology, that's been an important element. At the product level, seeing a little bit more comfort in the vehicle and taking a kind of an incremental step towards a fully autonomous vehicle and how that might look in terms of the steering wheel, as well as the back seats, and having a little bit more space to lounge while you're riding, make a lot of sense to us that they're doing that with their high end vehicles before they start rolling those sorts of design elements into the lower end vehicles. But I think for us, this was a major step forward with the 0 to 60 under two seconds is an impressive feat in a production vehicle, and I think it more than meets the needs of the company in terms of the product portfolio. SEANA SMITH: Colin, you said that this is a major step forward for the company. Any concern at all that they canceled the Plaid Plus? Or why, I guess can you give us any insight as to why you think that decision was made? COLIN RUSCH: I mean, honestly, I don't know why we need to go faster than 0 to 60 in two seconds or go 200 miles an hour. SEANA SMITH: That's a good point. COLIN RUSCH: [INAUDIBLE] they offer consumers at this point. It just, it seems like an unnecessary element that they didn't need and so they took it out. And so for us, it's really not a concern at all. JARED BLIKRE: We saw the Tesla stock take a hit off of those numbers that came out of China, various reports saying that they've lost market share there. Of course, they can export to the rest of the world, but is that a concern for you? And how does that fit into your valuation model? COLIN RUSCH: Yeah, for us short term, the company really is meeting demand that's well in excess of supply. And so if they have a little bit of a PR issue in China right now, I'm expecting them to shift a number of vehicles outside of China from those facilities. I'm not sure that it's actually impacting domestic demand all in. I do think that the company has had very sporadic month to month shipments in different geographies, and so we know that they have starved certain geographies and then fed them in various lumpy ways as they're able to get containerships to give them locations. And I think that's probably what we're seeing. Historically, we've seen the company deliver almost half of its vehicles in the last month of the quarter. And so we're really watching what the June numbers will ultimately be, and we'll see where those shake out here in a few weeks, just after the 1st of July with the delivery report. SEANA SMITH: Colin, we have shares trading just around $607 today. You have a price target of $1,000.80 bucks on this stock, about $400 from where we are. What's going to get us there? COLIN RUSCH: Our thesis from here is really about Tesla delivering on the autonomous opportunity. They've got by the end of the quarter, they'll have nearly a million and a half vehicles on the road collecting data and forming their AI and improving the system. We think that's a critical advantage versus all of their peers that are working still thousands of vehicles, and single digit thousands of vehicles. So we think the learning cycles are dramatically faster. And our expectation is that they're going to be rolling out incremental functionality around urban driving, left-hand turns, things like that in larger and larger set of geographies. And that's what we think ultimately drives the valuation here over the next 12 to 24 months is the delivery on that autonomous technology and to really be first to market with a fully autonomous vehicle. JARED BLIKRE: And when you look at Tesla's competition, and they have quite a bit of competition now, but especially from the legacy automakers, GM had a big push for EV earlier in the year, Ford had one within the last month, and Volkswagen, you look at all those stocks and they've been outperforming most of the EV plays over the last month or two. Is this a threat for Tesla? Because they are better capitalized and they have bigger factories and more resources right now. COLIN RUSCH: Well, I mean, Tesla is awfully well capitalized right now, north of $10 billion cash in hand, they're growing their factory base, so we're not worried about their capitalization. In terms of some of the startups and the newer companies in the EV space versus some of the legacy platforms, it actually is quite difficult to make EVs. We saw that with Tesla's teething pains early on in its development, and we've seen it with folks like VW in specific with their operating system over the last couple of years. So we're expecting that the larger OEMs that are established are going to figure this out and will make vehicles. They still, I think, are disadvantaged from a performance perspective versus Tesla, as well as from a brand perspective, given the evolution of the technology. And again, that's why we think this Plaid was important for us to get out into the public realm, because they are demonstrating a clear technology lead versus their peers, whether it's the established OEMs or some of the startups. JARED BLIKRE: And you have to appreciate the showmanship of Elon Musk himself, love it or hate it. Colin Rusch, thank you so much for joining us. Oppenheimer Senior Research Analyst.

The integration combines several open source software repositories, Storj\u2019s Amazon S3-compatible gateway powered by MinIO, Storj\u2019s integration with Rclone, and affordable hardware to automatically upload footage to the decentralized cloud, a vast improvement over the manual process used by most Tesla owners. \"One of our team\u2019s values is openness, and we are firmly committed to contributing to the open source software community and using integrations and capabilities delivered by other open source software developers,\" said JT Olio, Storj CTO. \"This integration not only enables Tesla owners to privately and securely manage their footage, but it also showcases how easy it is to integrate Storj DCS with open source software and how well the product can upload and stream data to locations all around the globe.\" All Tesla vehicles come with built-in sensors and cameras that can record Dashcam or Sentry Mode video. Dashcam footage is captured when a Tesla driver is operating their vehicle. Sentry Mode video is captured when the vehicle is parked, and someone approaches or movement is detected. Both modes must be manually enabled to record video, which is primarily stored on a USB drive inside the vehicle. The data must then be manually transferred to another device if the driver wishes to view, share, or store the video long-term. The integration was made using open source software maintained by GitHub user marcone and created by Reddit user drfrank, Storj\u2019s native integration with Rclone\u2014a popular open source software program for cloud backups, and a Raspberry Pi. Storj DCS has a free-tier so that Tesla owners can upload up to 150GB of footage to the service at no cost. The thorough documentation makes it easy for even less technical users to share and store their Tesla footage on Storj DCS. When video is uploaded to Storj DCS, it is encrypted, encoded for redundancy, and stored across a diverse set of Nodes worldwide. Once the footage is uploaded, Tesla drivers can easily share the video with friends, family, or other interested parties with just a click of a button through Storj\u2019s object browser using Storj Share functionality. From there, video can be streamed or downloaded to other devices. In addition to its native integration with Rclone, Storj DCS has been integrated with many other open source software tools used by developers worldwide, including FileZilla, MongoDB, Duplicati, Plesk, and more. These integrations are easy-to-use and enable developers to take advantage of the privacy, security, and cost benefits decentralized systems deliver. By integrating with Storj DCS, developer tools and platforms can give customers superior privacy and security.

It shows that Musk still sees a future for wider Bitcoin adoption after he criticized the digital currency for being an energy hog and relying too much on fossil fuels.

SAN CARLOS, Calif., June 10, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Iron Ox, a farming innovation company with deep expertise in robotics and artificial intelligence, has appointed former Impossible Foods and Tesla executive Rachel Konrad as its first independent board member.

The Cyber Police Department of the National Police of Ukraine confirmed that six arrests were made after searches at 21 residences in the capital Kyiv and nearby regions. While it's unclear whether the defendants are affiliates or core developers of the ransomware operation, they are accused of running a \"double extortion\" scheme, in which victims who refuse to pay the ransom are threatened with the leak of data stolen from their networks prior to their files being encrypted. \"It was established that six defendants carried out attacks of malicious software such as 'ransomware' on the servers of American and [South] Korean companies,\" alleged Ukraine's national police force in a statement. The police also seized equipment from the alleged Clop ransomware gang, said to behind total financial damages of about $500 million. This includes computer equipment, several cars \u2014 including a Tesla and Mercedes, and 5 million Ukrainian Hryvnia (around $185,000) in cash. The authorities also claim to have successfully shut down the server infrastructure used by the gang members to launch previous attacks. \"Together, law enforcement has managed to shut down the infrastructure from which the virus spreads and block channels for legalizing criminally acquired cryptocurrencies,\" the statement added. These attacks first began in February 2019, when the group attacked four Korean companies and encrypted 810 internal services and personal computers. Since, Clop \u2014 often styled as \"Cl0p\" \u2014 has been linked to a number of high-profile ransomware attacks. These include the breach of U.S. pharmaceutical giant ExecuPharm in April 2020 and the attack on South Korean e-commerce giant E-Land in November that forced the retailer to close almost half of its stores. Clop is also linked to the ransomware attack and data breach at Accellion, which saw hackers exploit flaws in the IT provider\u2019s File Transfer Appliance (FTA) software to steal data from dozens of its customers. Victims of this breach include Singaporean telecom Singtel, law firm Jones Day, grocery store chain Kroger, and cybersecurity firm Qualys. At the time of writing, the dark web portal that Clop uses to share stolen data is still up and running, although it hasn't been updated for several weeks. However, law enforcement typically replaces the targets' website with their own logo in the event of a successful takedown, which suggests that members of the gang could still be active. \u201cThe Cl0p operation has been used to disrupt and extort organizations globally in a variety of sectors including telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, aerospace, and technology,\" said John Hultquist, vice president of analysis at Mandiant's threat intelligence unit. \"The actor FIN11 has been strongly associated with this operation, which has included both ransomware and extortion, but it is unclear if the arrests included FIN11 actors or others who may also be associated with the operation.\u201d Hultquist said the efforts of the Ukrainian police \u201care a reminder that the country is a strong partner for the U.S. in the fight against cybercrime and authorities there are making the effort to deny criminals a safe harbor.\u201d The alleged perpetrators face up to eight years in prison on charges of unauthorized interference in the work of computers, automated systems, computer networks, or telecommunications networks and laundering property obtained by criminal means. News of the arrests comes as international law enforcement turns up the heat on ransomware gangs.

Several organisations, including MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Tesla, have invested billions of dollars into cryptocurrencies and traditional financial firms like PayPal (PYPL) and Goldman Sachs (GS) started to handle the asset on behalf of clients.\u00a0 Experts say the crypto craze fuelled interest in bitcoin miner Argo Blockchain (ARB.L). \"Argo Blockchain has seen a flurry of interest across social media which is likely to have help propel it into the top of the stocks for June,\" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Despite the optimism, cryptos face staunch opposition from governments and central banks which have been keen to regulate digital currencies. On Tuesday, the Bank of England (BoE) governor, Andrew Bailey, said digital currencies will not get a regulatory \"free pass\" in the future, despite their potential for innovation. Speaking at TheCityUK's annual conference, Bailey said the bank needs to \"provide a lead in setting out the rules of the road\", noting that playing catchup on digital currencies is not a recipe for success. Bailey doubled down on his earlier position that bitcoin is not money, and has no intrinsic value because it has no backing. He added that stablecoins have the potential to become systemic in terms of their importance in the financial system and its stability, and that UK authorities are already considering the regulatory approach for both systemic and non-systemic stablecoins. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority previously warned that if consumers invest in cryptoassets \"they should be prepared to lose all their money\".

In particular, Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets\u2019 investors will try and keep the momentum going in popular stocks after Friday\u2019s gains in GameStop and AMC Entertainment as well as meme-stock newcomer Clover Health. Last week, AMC closed below the USD 50 level after surpassing it on June 2. GameStop\u2019s earnings are in the rear-view mirror and its stock price has dipped well below the USD 300 mark. Clover is similarly off last week\u2019s high of more than USD 22. Short interest remains high in these names while retail investors strive to create a short squeeze.

MicroStrategy, in its latest move signaling support for bitcoin, will sell up to $1 billion of its stock to buy the asset. The company published the relevant SEC form on June 14. CEO Michel Saylor, now one of bitcoin\u2019s strongest proponents, also revealed the development on Twitter. MicroStrategy has been consistently doubling down on its bitcoin bet, having made a considerable return on investment on its bitcoin purchases with the bull run in the first few months of 2021. Clearly, the company and its leading figure are betting on bitcoin to grow moving forward. The company is one that sticks to its word. Just yesterday, on June 14, it sold $500 million in secured notes to buy roughly 11,900 BTC. The news pushed the stock price of MicroStrategy by 12%. MicroStrategy\u2019s interest in bitcoin goes beyond just purchasing BTC and sitting on the asset. The company\u2019s CEO is involving himself in more educational and awareness efforts, including the launch of a Bitcoin Mining Council. Recently, Saylor announced that the newly launched Bitcoin Mining Council would have a meeting on June 16 to discuss bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption and possible green energy solutions. Notably, Elon Musk will not be a part of the mining council, though he has held a call related to the council in the past. Musk\u2019s tweets set off a storm of headlines related to bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption, which subsequently sent the cryptocurrency\u2019s price tanking. The Tesla CEO said that the company would stop accepting bitcoin payments for Teslas until mining switched to cleaner sources of energy. Recently, he updated the status on this by saying that if there was confirmation of approximately 50% of mining using clean energy, as well as a \u201cpositive future trend,\u201d Tesla would start accepting bitcoin again. This helped bitcoin\u2019s price up, on top of the approval of the Taproot upgrade for the network. The Bitcoin Mining Council itself is an organization composed loosely of individuals, groups, and miners that will focus on bringing positive changes to mining on the network. The FAQ on the council\u2019s page goes so far as to say that it will not involve Elon Musk, assuaging the market\u2019s concerns on the Tesla CEO, which it has grown upset with.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to the 5 Penny Stocks Robinhood Traders are Buying in 2021. Robinhood Markets, the California-based financial technology firm that owns popular stock trading application Robinhood, is expected to debut on the stock market in the coming months, targeting a record market valuation of over $40 billion. Robinhood has gained prominence in the past few months as millions of new investors use the platform, primarily because it offers commission-free stock trading services, does not have a minimum account balance requirement, and has made trading essentially hassle-free. The application was developed by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt to unleash the micro-investor potential that had been bubbling away under the surface of the financial world for years but was held back by exuberant transaction fees and minimum investment requirements on the open market. In 2014, more than 300,000 people signed up for the application before launch. By 2015, this number had more than doubled. In May 2020, the New York Times claimed that Robinhood had 13 million active users. Over the past year, 3 million more have joined.  The average age of these users is around 30 and most bet on penny stocks with explosive growth potential. However, the interest in penny stocks does not hold them back from short-term plays on large-cap or mega-cap growth stocks like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG). Through the month of May, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) was the most popular stock on the application by a country mile with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) also featured.  However, penny stocks still remain some of the most traded on the application in terms of volume. The technology, biopharma, and marijuana industries are some of the markets that these retail investors seem most interested in, with most popular penny stocks falling in one of these three categories. Robinhood has been thriving off these trends, generating more than $680 million in revenue last year, a more than 500% increase compared to 2019, as the coronavirus lockdowns dramatically increased interest in digital trading.  The larger trends towards digital and fintech are expected to continue driving market trends in the coming months, further pummeling the traditional finance world that has been hit hard by tech-led disruption. The entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade, during which its hedged returns couldn\u2019t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey\u2019s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 124 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 26th 2021 our monthly newsletter\u2019s stock picks returned 197.2%, vs. 72.4% for the SPY. Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 124 percentage points (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16th. That\u2019s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

Thomas Ingenlath told Reuters in a telephone interview that the Polestar 3 is \"nicely suited for the U.S. as a ... big, tall, grown-up SUV. This is a win-win situation.\" The Volvo plant in Ridgeville, South Carolina, near Charleston, currently builds the Volvo S60 sedan and will add the Volvo XC90 SUV in 2022, Polestar said on Wednesday. The annual capacity at the plant, which opened in 2018, will be 150,000 vehicles with the Volvo and Polestar SUVs added, a Volvo spokesman said. The Polestar 3 will be built on the same electric premium platform, called the SPA2, as the XC90, Ingenlath said. It will compete with such models as Tesla Inc's Model X SUV. Sweden's Volvo Cars is owned by Geely. The Polestar SUV will initially be sold in the United States, but could eventually be exported, Ingenlath said. Polestar, which was launched in 2017, sells the low-volume halo Polestar 1 hybrid performance car for about $155,000. Its first high-volume car, the Polestar 2, sells for about $60,000. Both cars are built in China. Ingenlath said last year Polestar was targeting annual Polestar 2 sales of more than 50,000 vehicles within two to three years. He said that goal has not changed, but declined to give volume targets for the Polestar 3. The company also is developing a larger, more environmentally friendly sedan called Precept and will build that vehicle at a new plant in China. Ingenlath said taking Polestar public remained a possibility, but the focus is on raising funds to help the company grow. Last year he said Polestar would like eventually to be publicly listed. In April, Polestar raised $550 million from investors to accelerate product development and said further fund raising could occur.

When making that transition, commercial fleet operators are faced with the question of whether they should charge their vehicles in large numbers at depots or separately at drivers' homes. ChargePoint said its platform will combine software with its charging solutions to help recharge light to heavy-duty vehicles efficiently across depots, on route and at home. It will be available for early access fleet customers in summer and can be easily configured to meet depot requirements and scale as fleets grow and demand increases, the company said. ChargePoint operates more than 115,000 charging ports globally, mostly in North America, and has previously said it is aiming to increase that to 2.5 million by 2025. The company went public earlier this year by merging with a blank-check firm, Switchback Energy Acquisition Corp, in a deal that valued ChargePoint at $2.4 billion.

On May 25, Tesla, a U.S. electric vehicle company, announced that it would not use millimeter-wave radar in its Autopilot autonomous driving assistance system. The leading car company in autonomous driving technology will adopt a more audacious autonomous sensing solution. Environmental sensing is one of the core technologies of autonomous driving, and sensing and recognition cannot be achieved without sensors such as cameras, millimeter-wave radar and LiDAR. At present, there are two main solutions to the sensing technology of autonomous driving. One is visual computing with Tesla as a typical representative. This technology is composed of low-cost components such as millimeter-wave radar with camera as the dominant component. The other is composed of components such as camera and millimeter-wave radar with LiDAR as the dominant component. \"The former solution dominated by vision has low cost and is easy to massively produce, while the latter one dominated by LiDAR has the strength of accurate measurement but its cost is rather high. Both solutions have their own strengths and weaknesses,\" Yang Diange, a professor at School of Vehicle and Mobility Tsinghua University, said in an interview with a reporter from the 21st Century Business Herald. Tesla prefers the vision solution and its CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly defamed LiDAR in public, even so, there are still many car companies that regard LiDAR technology as the preferred solution to achieve higher-level autonomous driving. This year, a number of Chinese car companies have announced their plans for mass production of onboard LiDAR. Is LiDAR needed at this stage? The automotive-grade LiDAR has been developed for some time. In 2017, Valeo produced its first automotive-grade LiDAR for the Audi A8 massively. On May 31 of the same year, Gu Jianmin, CTO of Valeo China, told the reporter from the 21st Century Business Herald that Valeo had produced and delivered nearly 130 thousand LiDARs worldwide. It is understood that Valeo will massively produce LiDAR to install it on Nissan Legend model in March this year. In addition, Valeo\u2019s second generation LiDAR will be installed on the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class model and on another car company's models by mass production in Asia next year. However, Valeo's LiDAR has not been fully equipped on mass-produced vehicles, and it is only installed on some versions of some models. When the NIO ET7, Xiaopeng P5 and Alpha S models were launched, NIO, Xiaopeng and ArcFox all claimed to be the first to be equipped with mass-produced LiDAR. The models of the three car companies have been unveiled in the first half of this year and are scheduled to be delivered at the end of the year or in the first quarter of next year. It is worth noting that more and more car companies have announced this year that they are going to adopt LiDAR. However, some car companies did not have LiDAR in their previous model design plans. Moreover, the assistant driving mode of some car companies does not need LiDAR. The mass production and application of LiDAR is closely related to the technological development of autonomous driving. There is a general consensus in the industry that LiDAR is unnecessary for the L1 and L2 autonomous driving models and it will increase the cost. Nonetheless, for L3, L4 and higher-level autonomous driving models, whether it is necessary to use LiDAR is still a matter of controversy. In simple terms, the biggest use of LiDAR at present is to improve the sensing accuracy of autonomous driving in extreme weather and extreme conditions. Currently, the mass production and application of LiDAR still face difficulties and challenges. Three essential conditions must be met for equipping mass-produced self-driving car with LiDAR: ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles, reaching automotive grade and keeping mass-produced costs under control. In terms of cost, as the technology maturing and the scale expanding, most LiDAR companies now claim that their mass production costs have reached about US$1,000. Different from them, Wang Jun, president of Huawei Smart Car Solutions BU, previously said that the cost of its LiDAR could be reduced to $200 in an interview during Shanghai Auto Show this year. But he did not reveal exactly when the cost could be reduced to this. However, from the perspective of laws and regulations, L3 and higher level autonomous vehicles can only be driven in autonomous driving test areas or demonstration areas, high-level autonomous driving has not reached the requirements for obtaining permission of driving in complex roads in urban areas. Therefore, from the current stage, whether car companies need to equip mass-produced vehicles with LiDAR still needs to be considered in terms of various issues such as cost and the operational environment. 100 billion yuan market investment opportunity In accordance with the predicted data of investment institutions, by 2025, the value of global LiDAR market will reach $12.6 billion and that of the Chinese LiDAR market will reach $4.31 billion. By 2025, three out of every 100 private cars in China will be equipped with LiDAR. The development of autonomous driving technology has also made LiDAR a new industrial investment opportunity. In the second half of last year, startups such as Velodyne and Luminar listed on US stocks one after another. As a holographic AR company listed on Nasdaq, WiMi Hologram Cloud has received cumulative investments of $170 million from well-known institutions such as Weibo since its IPO in April 2020, so it has sufficient capital to realize the expansion of the holographic AR industry to establish a vigorous competitive strength. WiMi Hologram Cloud (WiMi.US) is able to provide first-class products and services with its powerful technical capabilities and infrastructure. After winning the bid of China Mobile and Media Cloud Platform Phase II Holographic Remote Interaction, WiMi Hologram Cloud is redefining the communication mode of China Mobile through \"5G+ Holographic Remote\".

The core business of WiMi Hologram Cloud is holographic AR technology for software engineering, media manufacturing services and cloud and big data. In addition to the above businesses, WiMi Hologram Cloud also enters the LiDAR field. Since the announcement of its patent of 3D holographic pulse laser processing device for optical hologram, strong market demands have been shown in several industries. Therefore, WiMi Hologram Cloud decides to develop 3D holographic pulse LiDAR product \"WiMi HoloPulse LiDAR\" to further expand its holographic product portfolio matrix. According to public records, WiMi Hologram Cloud focuses on holographic cloud services, which are mainly in the professional fields, such as, onboard AR holographic HUD, 3D holographic pulse LiDAR, head-mounted light field holographic device, holographic semiconductor, holographic cloud software and holographic car navigation. In conclusion, WiMi Hologram Cloud is a holographic cloud comprehensive technical solution provider, covering multiple links of holographic AR technology, and it includes holographic onboard AR technology, 3D holographic pulse LiDAR technology, holographic visual semiconductor technology, holographic software development, holographic AR advertising technology, holographic AR entertainment technology, holographic ARSDK payment, interactive holographic communication, etc. Due to the explosion of demand for holographic applications on vehicles, WiMi Hologram Cloud will develop holographic onboard devices, holographic onboard chips and holographic onboard software to meet the demands for holographic applications on vehicles.

Although the country\u2019s total vehicle sales for May 2021 fell 3% year over year, snapping the 13-month winning streak, electric vehicles remained a bright spot for the world\u2019s largest auto market. Per the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, NEVs including all-electric, hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles surged a whopping 160% year over year to 217,000 units in May, marking the 11th straight month of increase. Key electric vehicle (EV) firms based in China witnessed a massive surge in sales volumes last month. NIO Inc. NIO \u2014 dubbed as the Tesla TSLA of China \u2014 delivered 6,711 vehicles, marking a year-over-year rise of 95.3%. Li Auto LI and XPeng Inc. XPEV delivered 4,323 and 5,686 units, representing year-over-year growth of 101.3% and 483%, respectively. Warren-Buffett-backed BYD Co. Ltd. BYDDY sold 32,800 all-electric and hybrids vehicles, up 190% year over year. Pure electric passenger cars delivered by the firm jumped 126% year over year to 18,711 units. U.S.-based EV king Tesla sold 33,463 EVs made in China in May 2021, up from 25,845 sold in April, per the China Passenger Car Association (\u201cCPCA\u201d). China's NEV industry has been on the uptrend since July 2020, backed by government stimulus measures like extended subsidies and tax exemptions, which have boosted the sale of green vehicles.\u00a0Advancement in the EV charging infrastructure in the nation owing to state-of-the-art technologies is further driving the demand for eco-friendly vehicles. Buoyed by favorable government policies along with improving consumer confidence and economy, the rebound in green vehicle demand and sales is expected to continue. China-based EV makers including NIO, XPeng and BYD are actively expanding their production capacity in the country, thanks to the government's promotion of zero-emission vehicles. Banking on the EV euphoria in China, various auto biggies including Toyota, Volkswagen, General Motors GM and Ford F are ramping up investments in the China EV market.\u00a0 China\u2019s big push toward green vehicle adoption and EV supply chain dominance bodes well.\u00a0Importantly, the country projects EVs to account for 25% of new car sales by 2025.\u00a0CPCA projects NEV sales in China to hit 2.4 million units this year, indicating an increase from around 1.3 million units in 2020. Per a report by Deloitte, by 2030, China will account for 49% of the global EV market. During the China Auto Chongqung Summit held over the last weekend, Wang Chuanfu, the founder of BYD, predicted that sales of NEVs will account for 70% of China\u2019s new vehicle sales by 2030. NIO\u2019s founder, William Li, seems more optimistic, forecasting a penetration rate of 90%, per media reports. Given the upbeat scenario, we highlight four stocks that would help you capitalize on the China EV market\u2019s solid prospects.

The automaker today announced plans to electrify its entire vehicle lineup by 2030. It also pledged that half of its global volume will be zero-emission vehicles by 2025. Before then, Lincoln will debut its first fully electric car next year to coincide with its centenary.\u00a0 Ford recently earmarked $30 billion for electric vehicles as part of its plan to go all-electric in Europe by 2030. The ambitious strategy, dubbed Ford Plus, sees the US auto giant trying to catch up to rivals General Motors, Volkswagen and Tesla in the shift to electrification. In May, Ford announced that it was working on all-electric versions of its Explorer and Lincoln Aviator SUVs, along with two EV platforms respectively built for full-size trucks and all- and rear-wheel drive models.\u00a0 Today, Lincoln said its electrification goals fall under the Ford Plus umbrella. The company plans to utilize the EV platform for multiple vehicle types for four new fully electric cars. An electric charging network, underpinned by Electrify America's charging infrastructure and additional partners, is also in the works and will be accessible through the Lincoln Way app.\u00a0 The raft of announcements, including connected driving and tech upgrades (more on those below), follow Lincoln's decision to scrap its Rivian-based electric SUV due to complications caused by the pandemic. In terms of design, Lincoln's Zephyr Reflection concept, unveiled at the Auto Shanghai show in April, will serve as an aesthetical blueprint for future EV models, the company said. Though that Sedan is aimed at China, Lincoln will borrow its coast-to-coast display for its fully electric vehicle, with plans to update its Star logo and provide the kind of roomy interior you'd expect from its luxury output. Alongside the electric makeover, Lincoln is also working on a major tech upgrade for its lineup. The plans include a cloud-based Lincoln Intelligence System for connected vehicles, which will allow it to deliver iterative software updates for battery, power and computing systems. While newer models with Ford's Sync 4 infotainment system will receive continuous updates through the Lincoln Enhance platform. That includes the Lincoln Nautilus, which is due for its first update this summer, including improvements to the navigation system, Apple CarPlay and digital owner's manual. Later this fall, an additional update will provide enhancements for Amazon's Alexa digital assistant. In addition, the company will soon roll out ActiveGlide, a hands-free driving assistance feature that only works on sections of divided highways. It follows Ford's unveiling of its BlueCruise tech, destined for vehicles with Ford Co-Pilot360 (like the Mustang Mach-E) in the second half of the year via a Snyc 4 software update. Similar to GM's Super Cruise, Ford's feature can be operated on 100,000 miles of divided highways in the US and Canada. Further down the line, Lincoln plans to equip its future vehicles with a new Android Auto-powered digital platform. A Rejuvenation mode is also in the works that lets owners tinker with the display, lighting, massage, audio and even scent features to boost their wellbeing. Lincoln previously partnered with meditation app Calm to offer customers a year of its premium service through the Lincoln Way app. "}, {"source": "Yahoo Finance", "title": "10 Major Companies That Accept Bitcoin ", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-major-companies-accept-bitcoin-150009547.html", "date": "Sat, 12 Jun 2021 15:00:09 GMT", "content": "Elon Musk made waves in February when he announced that Tesla was buying $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin and accepting the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency as payment for its vehicles \u2014 yet another first for Musk in the auto industry.

Bitcoin is big and getting bigger, with some of the biggest corporations in America jumping on the bandwagon and accepting Bitcoin as payment. Here are the top 10 players in the game.  Last updated: May 17, 2021 Microsoft became an early adopter of Bitcoin in 2014 when it began accepting the cryptocurrency as payment for games, apps and other digital content for platforms like Windows Phone and Xbox. Bitcoin was still largely unknown in 2014 and many of those who were familiar heard about it for all the wrong reasons. It was a year of drama and scandal, with the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, collapsing into bankruptcy after a flurry of frauds, hacks and incidents that saw hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoins lost. At that time, a bar in New York City accepted Bitcoin, so did a few car services and restaurants, but very few other major companies to speak of \u2014 except for two.  Discover: Google, Microsoft Beat Earnings Estimates Thanks To Cloud Services, Ad Revenue If anyone was going to beat Microsoft to the punch, it makes sense that it would be the company that blazed the trail for modern digital payments. Microsoft began accepting Bitcoin at the end of 2014 in December \u2014 three months after PayPal got on board in September. Back then, Bitcoin was trading as XBT instead of BTC. As a testament to how unfamiliar the concept was then, CNN described Bitcoin as \u201can independent, government-less currency.\u201d PayPal\u2019s move was intended to draw businesses to its platform, not consumers. That draw was that Bitcoin\u2019s transaction fees were far lower than the profit-killing 2%-3% charge that businesses were paying for credit card transactions. In the News: Elon Musk Sends Doge Prices on a Rollercoaster After Tesla Drops Bitcoin Before Microsoft went crypto, and even before PayPal, Overstock.com was blazing the trail that those giants would follow. As early as 2018, CNN was reporting that Overstock was \u201cbasically a crypto company now,\u201d an exaggeration based on the online retailer\u2019s heavy investment in blockchain technology. By that time \u2014 before COVID boosted Overstock to its current status as one of the hottest e-commerce platforms in the world \u2014 it was already a Bitcoin veteran. In January 2014 \u2014 a full nine months before PayPal took the plunge in September of that same year and nearly a year before Microsoft \u2014 Overstock became the first major retailer to accept Bitcoin as payment. Economy Explained: Breaking Down the Basics of Cryptocurrency In May 2019, a cryptocurrency dam broke when a payments startup called Flexa joined forces with Gemini, a digital currency company owned by the Facebook-famous Winklevoss twins. The partnership\u2019s platform allowed big retailers to incorporate Flexa into the digital scanners they were already using to accept phone-based payments through Apple Pay and other digital wallets. The technology instantly converted Bitcoins into dollars for seamless purchases. One of the first of those big retailers to adopt the technology was Whole Foods. Whole Foods is owned by Amazon, but Amazon itself does not, as of now, accept Bitcoin for purchases made through the world\u2019s largest online retailer.  Find Out: What Are Altcoins \u2014 and Are the Potential Rewards Worth the Risks? Etsy itself doesn\u2019t have a platform for accepting Bitcoin as payment sitewide, but the independent sellers who populate its platform can accept crypto in their individual shops if they choose. It\u2019s up to the seller to add an \u201cother\u201d payment method option at checkout. When buyers click that option, they\u2019ll be able to message the buyer with their payment preferences \u2014 Bitcoin, in this case. The seller then responds with a Bitcoin address to complete the transaction. The Etsy Community forum has a special page dedicated to Bitcoin with tutorials that explain how sellers can advertise that they accept Bitcoin and how to make the process go smoothly.

Like Etsy, Starbucks dipped its toes in the water instead of diving right into accepting crypto as cash. You can\u2019t pay for your Frappuccinos with Bitcoin at the register, but you can add Bitcoin \u2014 along with things like gift card balances and frequent-flyer miles \u2014 to the Starbucks app and pay that way. That upgrade was made possible by a third-party digital wallet app called Bakkt that converts Bitcoin to dollars to make payments not just possible, but instantaneous. See: What Is Chainlink and Why Is It Important in the World of Cryptocurrency? Online electronics giant Newegg accepts Bitcoin \u2014 and they\u2019ve gone all-in. Unlike some of the others that require you to convert crypto to cash through an app or third-party service, Newegg just lets you pay outright. For shoppers who are buying through a computer, all they have to do is choose \u201cPay With Bitcoin'' and go through the motions of shipping. For shoppers making purchases with their phones, Newegg will send a QR code to scan. For anyone who\u2019s looking to get started harvesting Bitcoins on their own, Newegg also sells cryptocurrency mining starter kits. The Economy and Your Money: All You Need To Know Home Depot, too, is using the Winklevoss/Flexa system \u2014 the same one that allowed Whole Foods to accept Bitcoin through its own digital scanners without investing in new hardware. Retailers have to submit balance sheets in dollars no matter what form of payment they accept, which was long a big stumbling block for companies that wanted to accept Bitcoin but didn\u2019t know how. Flexa converts Bitcoin to dollars instantaneously, which gives both parties what they want. The buyer gets to spend their Bitcoins when they buy their paint and Ryobi tools, and Home Depot gets the green dollars they require in exchange. Read More: Where Does Cryptocurrency Come From? Japanese cashback/shopping site Rakuten began letting users choose Bitcoin as a payment option in 2015. As part of a global Bitcoin rollout, the company started with Rakuten.com in the U.S. before expanding the new service to its counterparts in Germany and Austria. Rakuten made it possible by integrating the Bitnet payment processing platform into its own marketplaces. It has since developed Rakuten Wallet, which has expanded to support altcoins like Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum. Users can now charge their Rakuten Cash balance using crypto assets. More Economy Explained: How Does Cryptocurrency Work \u2013 and Is It Safe? Twitch is the 800-pound gorilla on the streaming video platform block. Like Whole Foods, Twitch is owned by Amazon. Also like Whole Foods, it now accepts cryptocurrency \u2014 and not just Bitcoin. Users can pay in Bitcoin, but also Bitcoin Cash and Ether, as well as lesser-used coins like BUSD, PAX, GUSD, USDC, and XRP. Twitch was one of the earliest adopters of crypto, adding it as a payment option in 2014. That, however, ended in 2019 when Twitch quietly removed its Bitcoin service. In June 2020, however, Twitch brought that capability back to the delight of its crypto-conscious users.

According to the parameters set forward by \u201cSpeedy Trial,\u201d if at least 90% of the blocks mined in any of the designated two-week difficulty periods \u201csignal\u201d their support for the upgrade, then the activation process can begin. To be more precise: 1,815\u00a0out of 2,016 blocks mined within a period have to include a little piece of encoded information that indicates that the miners who mined those blocks are in favor of the upgrade. During this second difficulty period, at block 687284, that benchmark was met. By the time the difficulty period ends on Sunday, it is likely Taproot will have locked in with over 99% of blocks signaling decisively in its favor. Related: Bitcoin Fund Outflows Slow but Investors Start Exiting Ether Funds Taproot is Bitcoin\u2019s most anticipated upgrade since Segregated Witness (SegWit) in 2017. Whereas the main focus of SegWit was scaling the Bitcoin protocol, Taproot will outfit Bitcoin with a new signature scheme known as Schnorr signatures. This small adjustment to the Bitcoin code opens up new possibilities for privacy, multisignature wallets and security, as well as scaling. Now that the threshold has been met, the end of this difficulty period on Sunday will mark the completion of the first phase of Speedy Trial. Speedy Trial is the process the Bitcoin community of developers and stakeholders agreed to use to determine if there was enough support from the miners to go ahead with the Taproot soft fork. For months, even once it was clear that there was widespread support for the upgrade, there was still debate as to how it would be implemented. Any alteration to Bitcoin\u2019s code require consensus; there is no one person or entity \u201cin charge\u201d that can unilaterally make those changes. Arriving at that consensus can sometimes be even more complicated than writing the code itself. In the case of Taproot, Speedy Trial, devised by David Harding and Russell O\u2019Connor, was the solution that got the most community support. Related: Paul Tudor Jones Could Go &#8216;All In&#8217; on Inflation Trades, Wants 5% Bitcoin Allocation Now that the Taproot soft fork upgrades are locked in, the next phase of activation is basically a five-month waiting period. During this time, miners and nodes will have ample opportunity to update their software to Bitcoin Core 0.21.1, the newest version of Bitcoin Core that contains activation logic for the\u00a0Taproot\u00a0soft fork (and some other improvements). Finally, in November, when Bitcoin reaches a specified \u201cblock height\u201d (Bitcoin block 709,632), Taproot will activate; that is, the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) relevant to Taproot and contained in Bitcoin Core 0.21.1 will automatically kick in. At that point, all upgraded nodes and devices will be able to recognize and accept transactions made using that upgraded protocol. From there, it will be up to developers in the Bitcoin ecosystem to make use of the tools that Taproot brings to the table, specifically Schnorr signatures, which will replace Bitcoin\u2019s current elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA).\u00a0 These smaller and faster Schnorr signatures also have the added benefit of being \u201clinear,\u201d a combination that will boost Bitcoin\u2019s transaction privacy and allow for more lightweight and complex \u201csmart contracts\u201d (an encoded contract with self-executing rules). In the long run, Taproot\u2019s tooling and coding improvements will translate to a better user experience for bitcoiners in terms of overall performance, as well as privacy improvements to multisignature (multisig) technology, privacy software and even scaling tech like the Lightning Network. MicroStrategy Raises $500M From Bond Sale to Buy More Bitcoin Bitcoin \u2018Options Smile\u2019 Shows Market Fearful of Downside Despite Tesla News "}, {"source": "Yahoo Finance", "title": "Andreessen Horowitz Has Its Own Media: So Far That\u2019s a Good Thing ", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/andreessen-horowitz-own-media-far-220143626.html", "date": "Tue, 15 Jun 2021 22:01:43 GMT", "content": "Today marked the launch of Future.com, a media outlet funded by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Commentators, particularly media figures, have engaged in some justifiable hand-wringing about the implications of a venture capital firm starting an \u201cowned media\u201d operation. That anxiety has been heightened by a broader context of Trumpist skepticism towards the media, and a wave of tech-specific media backlash spearheaded by companies like Tesla and influential figures like Balaji Srinivasan. After looking at the first wave of items published on Future.com today, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much reason to panic about the site. In fact, there\u2019s much to admire, including an abundance of smart and informative pieces on cryptocurrency systems. I hope other entities planning to open in-house media, including Coinbase, are taking notes \u2013 because while Future.com looks great, the risks of such an operation are still real. David Z. Morris is CoinDesk\u2019s chief insights columnist. Related: On the Road: A Lesson About Open Access and Bitcoin Above all, it\u2019s good that Future.com is explicitly an opinion and educational publication, not a news site. In broad terms, that\u2019s important because there would be an inherent, deep conflict of interest to a16z reporting news about specific companies that it was invested in, or companies that competed with its investments. It would have strong motivations to distort or omit facts in ways that benefited it. I trust a16z enough that I\u2019d expect it to run a clean operation, but even the perception of such conflicts would have made its content much less valuable. Instead of news about the present, Future.com is focused on theories about, well \u2026. the future. Its first round of articles includes incredibly deep thought pieces about hybrid work and the future of intellectual property on DAOs, for instance. These pieces cite information about specific companies, and some are authored by the staffers from Andreessen portfolio firms. But they\u2019re primarily about problems or opportunities shared by many different companies. The depth and subtlety of these pieces is another notable point in Future.com\u2019s favor. This piece on the lessons of containerization in shipping from Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen, for instance, clocks in at nearly 2,200 words (about nine printed pages), and includes wonky details about things like changing China-U.S. transit times and container ship size. Speaking as someone with nearly a decade of experience in the news business, it\u2019s very rare for content of this depth to find a home at for-profit media sites. For one, the business model often can\u2019t support paying writers for the amount of work involved. Even commentary from people like CEOs, while often provided gratis to publications, is usually streamlined to cater to readers interested in speed, not depth. Related: Kim Kardashian and Ethereum Max. Why? From that perspective, Future.com models perhaps the best reason for tech companies to bypass the mainstream media \u2013 not to present their perspective to the general public, but to provide a level of mind-numbing, un-economical depth in which only insiders are likely to be interested. The thing I would compare Future.com to most, in fact, isn\u2019t a news site like CoinDesk or Bloomberg, but an academic research journal. The site isn\u2019t peer-reviewed, but it shares much of the same insularity as journals. Margit Wennmachers, one of the heads of the project, told TechCrunch that it\u2019s aimed at \u201ctech people\u201d and \u201cthe tech curious.\u201d The contributors include tech CEOs, professional investors, and more than a few actual academics. The site\u2019s presentation is almost aggressively low-key: As of now, for instance, there are no images on the site\u2019s frontpage. That would be absolutely suicidal for a standalone news site trying to catch the eye of a casual observer. This emphasis on dry, academic depth should be additive to existing news sites, rather than competitive. It also significantly reduces the possibility that its contents will be manipulative, for the simple reason that easily-manipulated people tend to have really short attention spans and little appetite for learning. More abstractly, it\u2019s also arguably a benefit to readers that they know not to expect objectivity from Future.com. A16z is an investment firm, and seems set on using the new site primarily to flesh out the thinking behind its own investments. In investment circles that\u2019s known as \u201ctalking your own book,\u201d and it\u2019s pretty common and unproblematic behavior \u2013 as long as it\u2019s transparent that that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing. Future.com could definitely improve on its transparency by adding explicit disclosures of its investments to related stories. Currently its disclosures take the form of a boilerplate small-text block at the end of each story, without specific investments cited. But the kinds of readers willing to slog through 2,000 words on the future of robot lawyers would also take a moment to click over to the a16z disclosures page to figure out that it was written by the CEO of a portfolio company. All that being said, there\u2019s a larger context here that is still worrying. Tech companies publishing what are effectively their business theses seems fair enough, but it does risk reducing the traditional press\u2019s ability to ask hard questions of the businesses themselves. This has already happened with Tesla, a company that can communicate directly with its rabid fanbase so effectively that it actually disbanded its public relations department in 2020. There\u2019s literally nobody there anymore to answer questions from the press, a situation that ultimately increases the risk for Tesla stockholders. Maybe Future.com will become influential enough that a16z companies also decide to go direct. And a16z, with its track record of backing operations like Facebook, Instagram, and Clubhouse, certainly knows how to reach and engage a truly mass audience. But for now, that seems if anything to be the opposite of the thinking behind Future.com. Tesla was able to connect with a wide swathe of retail investors largely thanks to its flashy, charismatic and impulsive CEO. Andreessen Horowitz seems to know it can\u2019t pull off the same trick. Instead, its operation is leaning hard into being, frankly, boring as hell for anyone who isn\u2019t already extraordinarily well-informed. And that should be just fine by media professionals.

Markets expect no immediate changes to monetary policy, but with positioning heavily loaded against the dollar, investors are leery of any shift in tone that could spark a rally. The euro perched at $1.2120, just above a one-month low of $1.2093 it hit last week. The yen hit a seven-session low of 110.15 per dollar. The U.S. dollar index held near the top of its recent range at 90.512. \"The Fed is confronted with a balancing act of walking a tight-rope between transition and tantrums,\" said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho in Singapore. \"(A) solid U.S. economic recovery flanked by inflation at a 13-year high demands some kind of acknowledgement, if not response,\" he said. \"The euro, Aussie, Yen and Singapore dollar (levels) all point to cognisance about upside dollar risks.\" The Australian dollar has traded sideways this year, despite rapid rises in commodity prices, as markets have focused on U.S. data and the Fed to drive the U.S. dollar. The Aussie slipped marginally to $0.7705 on Tuesday after minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's last meeting showed the bank was prepared to keep buying bonds even though the economy has recovered its pre-pandemic output. The kiwi dollar and sterling were also settled in narrow ranges as market volatility gauges tick down to their lowest levels since the pandemic began roiling markets in February and March 2020. Ahead of the Fed's statement and news conference on Wednesday, markets will eye U.S. retail sales and a manufacturing survey later on Tuesday - though mostly as a means of understanding the economic pressure on policymakers. So far Fed officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, have stressed that rising inflationary pressures are transitory and ultra-easy monetary settings will stay in place for some time to come, although recent economic data has raised concerns that price pressure could force an earlier stimulus withdrawal. \"While Powell will tread carefully, I expect that the Fed is warming to a more open discussion about tapering, to be formally announced in the September meeting,\" Chris Weston, head of research at broker Pepperstone in Melbourne, said in a note to clients. \"Any view that cements a formal announcement in September should be modestly USD bullish, but the risks are symmetrical as Powell will be keen to not hurt financial conditions,\" he said. Nearly 60% of economists in a Reuters poll expect a tapering announcement in the next quarter. In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was able to steady above $40,000 on Tuesday and is approaching its 200-day moving average - finding support from the promise of fresh investment from major backer MicroStrategy and from Elon Musk. Tesla boss Musk on Sunday flagged that the carmaker could resume transactions using the token if miners can use cleaner energy to process them. Ether also got a small lift in sympathy with its bigger rival, and broke above its 20-day moving average to $2,593.40. ======================================================== Currency bid prices at 418 GMT Description RIC Last U.S. Close Pct Change YTD Pct High Bid Low Bid Previous Change Session Euro/Dollar $1.2124 $1.2121 +0.03% -0.77% +1.2126 +1.2114 Dollar/Yen 110.0650 110.0650 +0.00% +6.56% +110.1450 +110.0600 Euro/Yen Dollar/Swiss 0.8994 0.8995 +0.02% +1.70% +0.9001 +0.8994 Sterling/Dollar 1.4111 1.4105 +0.05% +3.29% +1.4117 +1.4100 Dollar/Canadian 1.2138 1.2149 -0.09% -4.68% +1.2150 +1.2137 Aussie/Dollar 0.7711 0.7712 -0.01% +0.24% +0.7716 +0.7696 NZ 0.7153 0.7144 +0.15% -0.36% +0.7157 +0.7132 Dollar/Dollar All spots Tokyo spots Europe spots Volatilities Tokyo Forex market info from BOJ (Reporting by Kevin Buckland in Tokyo and Tom Westbrook in Singapore; Editing by Kim Coghill) "}, {"source": "Yahoo Finance", "title": "Macron says Brexit deal must be honoured ", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macron-says-brexit-deal-must-141435031.html", "date": "Sun, 13 Jun 2021 14:14:35 GMT", "content": "CARBIS BAY, France, June 13 (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday said that France respects Britain's sovereignty but it is time to end rows over sausages and focus on more serious issues.

At a gala dinner in Shanghai, the founder of Chinese electric carmaker Nio Inc. can barely move forward in the buffet queue before being stopped for another selfie, handshake or hug. Swapping his usual attire of jeans and a T-shirt for a tailored grey suit and blue dress shirt, the tall 46-year-old happily obliges with a smile. Li manages to spoon a small amount of fried rice and vegetables onto his plate, but he\u2019s not here for the food. Over the next three hours, Li poses for hundreds more photos, chatting with customers of the automaker he started just over six years ago and has built into a way of life \u2014 at least for the people who buy his cars \u2014 with clubhouses, a round-the-clock battery recharging service and even clothing, food and exercise equipment, all decked out in Nio\u2019s geometric logo. As Li works the room, a video backdrop shows six performers, each wearing a different-colored Nio hoodie, singing a self-composed song dedicated to the company. \u201cMeeting with Nio, we want to be better selves,\u2019\u2019 the not-so-catchy ditty goes. While other billionaire executives may cringe at spending their down time glad-handing customers, for Li this is core. Nio\u2019s business model relies on creating a sense of allegiance among buyers, who then persuade friends and family to spread the word about its cars. Dubbed \u201cRippling Mode,\u2019\u2019 the strategy invokes the ever-widening circles caused by throwing a single stone into a pond, Li says. The scene in Shanghai was just what he was aiming for: a passionate customer base with the loyalty of Apple Inc. fans \u2014 and a dash of Elon Musk cult-of-personality thrown in. It\u2019s an approach that\u2019s turned Nio into Musk\u2019s most visible nemesis in a country that seems to be minting Tesla adversaries every other day. While other electric vehicle companies may pump out more cars aimed at the mass market, Nio is targeting the premium buyers that Musk \u2014 who established his first Gigafactory outside the U.S. on the outskirts of Shanghai in 2019 \u2014 needs to realize his ambitions for global growth and long-term profitability. China is ground-zero in the transition away from gas-guzzlers to alternative-energy cars, with the government intent on dominating a new automotive era that has triggered an onslaught of investment over the past six months and that even the U.S. is now embracing. The biggest car market on the planet, China is already the world\u2019s largest for EVs. Sales will reach 2 million this year and surge to 6.2 million vehicles by 2025, when they will account for a quarter of all passenger car sales in the country, according to BloombergNEF. Urbane, early adopters in China\u2019s biggest cities have been at the heart of that transition, and are prime targets for both Nio and Tesla. Nio\u2019s premium ES6 SUV competes head-to-head with the sporty Model Y that Tesla started making in China last year. It\u2019s a tussle that\u2019s front and center for Li, who in an interview with Bloomberg talked about how the eldest of his two sons, a first grader, wants to follow in his footsteps. \u201cOne day he told me that he would study hard and work hard, helping dad beat Tesla when he grows up,\u201d said Li. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be too late, I said.\u201d These days, that prospect is looking less like wishful thinking. Nio delivered more than 20,000 vehicles, all of them SUVs, in the first quarter at an average price of $68,000, while Tesla shipped around 17,000 of its Model Y sports utility vehicle in China, which starts at around $53,000. Nio's share of the overall China market for higher end cars is second only to Tesla, according to Kang Jun, an analyst at consultancy LMC Automotive, and it's set a \u201cbenchmark\u201d for the wider EV space, \u201cparticularly in product and service innovation.\u201d Tesla has also faced a raft of setbacks of late in China, which accounted for more than 20% of all revenue last year. Increased scrutiny from local regulators has been accompanied by a rising backlash against Tesla and its cars, culminating in one owner climbing on top of a Model 3 at the recent Shanghai Auto Show, claiming the company failed to address issues with her vehicle\u2019s brakes. The protest, which went viral in China, unleashed a wave of complaints about Tesla\u2019s customer service, the very thing Li \u2014 who regularly replies to queries from Nio owners on the company\u2019s app and has taken weekend trips across China to meet customers \u2014 has used to differentiate Nio in the cut-throat EV landscape. But Tesla isn\u2019t the only foe Li has to worry about. A Battle Royale is brewing in China\u2019s new energy car market \u2014 where retail sales of battery-powered passenger vehicles jumped 10% to 1.11 million last year, despite the hit from the pandemic \u2014 one that will challenge both Nio and Tesla, and set the stage for global control over the future of cars. After years watching from the sidelines, the big auto-making giants are doubling down on EVs, with Volkswagen AG launching an eight-car range from its platform designed for battery electric cars in China, Toyota Motor Corp. unveiling a new EV platform, and premium carmakers like BMW AG aiming for one-quarter of all Chinese sales to be electric. At the same time, Big Tech is eyeing the sector, lured by the technological possibilities. Chinese search-engine titan Baidu Inc. to smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. and networks giant Huawei Technologies Co. have pledged almost $19 billion into the EV and autonomous driving space since the start of the year alone. Smaller companies like Nio \u2014 which is listed with compatriots Xpeng Inc. and Li Auto Inc. in New York, putting them on the radar of U.S. investors \u2014 will face greater pressure as multinationals enter the fray, said Zhang Xiang, an auto-industry researcher at North China University of Technology in Beijing. \u201cIt\u2019s by no means a time they can rest easy.\u201d Nio has already had one near-death experience. Carmaking is typically a capital-intensive business, but with Nio, Li has sought to create a brand beyond the vehicles, an approach he describes as \u201cthe pursuit of being a user-enterprise.\u2019\u2019 The most visible manifestation of that was the Nio House, an elite drop-in center for the company\u2019s customers \u2014 even offering art and music classes for their kids \u2014 and located on prime real estate in some of China\u2019s biggest cities. It was coupled with extravagant marketing events. The carmaker holds annual Nio Days, and at the first in 2017 paid for flights and luxury hotels for everyone who ordered a vehicle a year before production started. R&B star Bruno Mars headlined the 2018 event. When its public charging facilities are overwhelmed, Nio has a fleet of cars that can take portable battery chargers to users wherever they\u2019re parked. Such largesse, along with a major recall after some cars caught fire just as China shifted subsidies from EV purchases to support the charging network, saw Nio rack up $5 billion of losses in its first four years of existence (Tesla took about 15 years to reach that particular milestone). By the second quarter of 2019, the company was losing around $5 million a day. \u201cIt was our darkest time,\u2019\u2019 Li said. A team met nightly to comb through expenses, from salaries to the cost of Nio Houses. \u201cIt was easy to calculate how much we could earn from selling cars, but we had to mind for everything to sustain a normal operation,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cEvery dollar counted.\u201d By October 2019, it looked like the gig was up. After posting a worse-than-expected quarterly loss, Nio\u2019s shares plunged to a record low of $1.32. At its nadir, the carmaker had lost more than 70% of its market capitalization \u2014 about $5 billion in value \u2014 from its New York initial public offering a year earlier. Even a $200 million cash injection from a sale of convertible notes to Li and an affiliate of Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. \u2014 an early investor in both Nio and Tesla \u2014 wasn\u2019t enough to shore up the company\u2019s seemingly insatiable need for cash. The setbacks kept coming. Nio couldn\u2019t afford the final payment on an imported stamping presser, a large machine used to shape a car\u2019s panels. Worse, it had to sell the presser at a discount to Tesla, which promptly installed it in its new Shanghai plant, built with loans and support facilitated by the government. Soon after, a deal for as much as 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) in funding from a Beijing local government-backed firm fell apart. Analysts started to openly speculate that Nio may be delisted or taken over. The situation got so dire that in late 2019, He Xiaopeng, the engineer founder of Guangzhou-based Xpeng, itself in a tenuous position with just 3 billion yuan in cash, proposed a merger of the two struggling electric carmakers, according to an interview He gave to Chinese state media. Li rejected the offer. \u201cNio was already in the intensive care unit, while Xpeng was waiting outside,\u2019\u2019 Li recalled. \u201cA merger would bury both of us.\u201d (Xpeng went on to be the third Chinese EV startup to list in the U.S., raising $1.5 billion in August 2020. The surge of investment in the space has seen its shares more than double, even accounting for a recent dip, and the company is now setting up a third Chinese production base to meet demand.) Then came the lifeline that showed the lengths China will go to maintain its ambition of creating a world-leading EV industry. In early 2020, the municipal government in Hefei \u2014 the capital of Li\u2019s home province of Anhui, about 600 miles southeast of Beijing \u2014 came knocking. Despite the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, which initially paralyzed car sales, a deal was struck in which the Hefei government would lead an injection of 10 billion yuan into Nio, more than the company\u2019s entire revenue for 2019. Coming just months after Nio said it wouldn\u2019t have enough money to continue operating for another year unless it got more funds, the agreement essentially provided the company with a state-backed security blanket. That can be a key advantage in China, where the government is the biggest player in almost every industry and has a hand in everything from manufacturing permits to access to capital. It could also provide a decisive edge over Tesla, which seems to have lost the favor it enjoyed early on with Beijing, as tensions with Washington continue to simmer under President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. For Nio, the quid-pro-quo was supporting local industry. The company abandoned plans to build a factory in Shanghai in early 2019, and instead \u2014 unlike Tesla and most traditional automakers \u2014 it pays a government-owned manufacturer in Hefei called Jianghuai Automobile Group Co., or JAC, to make its cars. The deal was extended last month for another three years, with JAC agreeing to double monthly capacity to 20,000 vehicles. \u201cWhen William Li brought his proposal to us, most people thought it was fantasy that a Chinese carmaker planned to build first-rate intelligent electric vehicles,\u2019\u2019 former JAC Chairman An Jin said. \u201cI might be the person with the best knowledge of how Nio came along, with all the challenges and difficulties. In its hardest time, William even devoted his own money to solve the problem. That\u2019s how he fought for his dreams.\u2019\u2019 At an April 7 ceremony to mark the production of Nio\u2019s 100,000th vehicle, Li said he would work with the Hefei government to establish an intelligent-vehicle production base, including an R&D facility. Construction started later that month, and the industrial park is expected to eventually house manufacturing workshops, along with other players in the EV supply chain. The Hefei pact, described as a government bailout by Sanford C. Bernstein\u2019s senior analyst Robin Zhu, \u201cput speculation around Nio\u2019s funding issues to bed, at least in the foreseeable future,\u201d he said. Li, though, also credits his loyal customer base. \u201cWe sold over 8,000 cars in the fourth quarter of 2019, which was pivotal to our survival,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I always say that our customers saved us. Even if we sold 500 or 1,000 fewer vehicles, that could have triggered a total collapse.\u2019\u2019 Still, the experience was chastening. Nio cut about a quarter of its workforce, slowed its efforts on autonomous driving, delayed wage payments for managers and spun off some non-core businesses. While the rollout of the costly Nio Houses was suspended for more than a year, the strategy of putting Nio ownership at the center of an owners\u2019 lifestyle and creating an aura of exclusivity, wasn\u2019t forsaken with more modest Nio Spaces rolled out. Usually around 100-200 square meters (1,100-2,150 square feet), Nio Spaces are located in cheaper locales and also sometimes in smaller cities. They cost about 1 million yuan to set up, much less expensive than the more salubrious Nio Houses. It seems to have worked \u2014 for now. Nio is still yet to turn a profit but its sales have risen steadily since \u2014 topping $1 billion for the first time in the three months to Dec. 31, 2020. The company narrowed its net loss in the first quarter of 2021 to 451 million yuan, down from 1.69 billion yuan a year earlier and 1.39 billion yuan in the fourth quarter of 2020. Even the businesses that underpin Nio\u2019s lifestyle brand are making money, contributing to 1.1 billion yuan in revenue from non-vehicle sales last year, according to the company\u2019s annual report. \u201cTo enter the car industry and survive isn\u2019t easy,\u2019\u2019 said Jochen Goller, BMW\u2019s China CEO. \u201cSome others have disappeared. I have met with William Li a couple of times and I have to say I am impressed by what he has achieved. Nio is also creating awareness for battery cars, and having the right brands in the segment is helping the market.\u2019\u2019 The Hefei deal also came around the same time as investors cottoned on to the EV revolution, putting a rocket under Nio\u2019s shares. They surged more than 1,110% last year, besting even the rally that propelled Tesla into the S&P 500 Index. The stock has given up some of those gains since as enthusiasm has eased, but with a market value of $70 billion, Nio is still bigger than Ford Motor Co. It\u2019s a long way from Li\u2019s relatively humble beginnings. Raised by his grandparents in a small village in the hills of Anhui, known for farming and \u2014 more recently \u2014 the automobile industry, Li calls himself one of China\u2019s \u201cfirst generation of `left-behind\u2019 children\u2019\u2019 because both his parents moved to the neighboring province of Jiangsu to pursue better work. There was no electricity in the village until Li was in his teens. While majoring in sociology at Peking University, one of China\u2019s top colleges, Li started his first business \u2014 leasing internet servers and helping clients register domain names. The auto industry is where Li has enjoyed his greatest success, however, with the three listed companies he founded in the past 20 years all related to cars. His first, a vehicle-pricing portal called BitAuto Holdings Ltd. was acquired last year by Yiche Holding Ltd. for $2.8 billion, propelling Li\u2019s personal fortune to $7 billion. That was followed by online auto-finance platform Yixin Group Ltd., which listed in Hong Kong in late 2017. Then came Nio. In an internal presentation in 2016, Li recalled looking out the window of his apartment at Beijing\u2019s smoggy skies before the birth of his first son, and decided something needed to be done to tackle the country\u2019s chronic pollution. He started Nio in late 2014 with funding from a group of well-known investors, including Li Auto founder Li Xiang and Richard Liu, the founder of e-commerce portal JD.com. Xiaomi\u2019s Lei Jun was also an early backer. When he\u2019s not dining with super-fans, Li\u2019s workday calendar is packed. On a recent Tuesday at the company\u2019s corporate headquarters \u2014 which remain in the slick financial capital of Shanghai \u2014 he spent the morning locked in executive committee meetings. In the afternoon, it was more back-to-back meetings with the company\u2019s battery partner, designers, and clients from Europe. In a first, Nio recently announced plans to start selling cars in EV hotbed Norway. But while the company is on much firmer ground than 18 months ago, questions remain. \u201cAuto manufacturing has big economies of scale, and at less than 100,000 units a year, Nio hasn\u2019t yet reached the production volume to realize all of those efficiencies,\u201d said Robert Cowell, an equity analyst at Shanghai-based 86Research. Cost issues linger, with the price of raw materials used in batteries, the most expensive part of an EV, including lithium-ion compound, soaring in recent months. Like most global automakers, Nio has also been hit by a worldwide shortage of the chips used increasingly in modern cars, leading to the suspension of production in Hefei for five days at the end of March. And despite the intensifying competition in an industry defined by technological advances and consumers drawn to the next shiny thing, Nio isn\u2019t planning on unveiling any new models until late this year or early 2022. Read more: Why Nio Should Resist the Siren Song of Norway While Tesla is the main competitor in view, it\u2019s the rivals to come that Li sees as the biggest threat. \u201cThe final game won\u2019t start until tech giants are in,\u201d he said. In March, Xiaomi unveiled plans to invest about $10 billion in manufacturing EVs, while Huawei has collaborated on at least two cars and is developing autonomous driving technologies. Lurking in the background is the biggest tech giant of all \u2014 Apple, which has long harbored ambitions to make its own, self-driving car. \u201cI trust companies like Apple for their determination, software development, intelligence capability, and user connection,\u2019\u2019 Li said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be different competition from traditional car companies.\u201d But like Musk and other EV evangelists, Li is looking to the long game. \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic,\u201d he said. \u201cBy 2030, 90% of the newly launched cars will be electric, or even 95%.\u201d For the Nio fans gathered in Shanghai that Sunday evening, that future is already here. With the event drawing to a close, owners pose for a large group photo with Li at its center, everyone flashing thumbs up. As the lights dim, Li slips out of the hall and into the night, where his driver \u2014 in a white Nio ES8 \u2014 waits to take him home.

If 2020 was the year that broke the ESG bank. This year, and next, might see investors start to reap the rewards of Biden\u2019s ultimate \u201cgreen presidency\u201d. In March, Biden unveiled a $2.3-trillion infrastructure plan. On Earth Day, Biden pledged to half U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. According to CNBC, Biden\u2019s climate agenda will likely be a \u201cwindfall for ESG investors\u201d. Gains investors have made so far this year have been stunning enough \u2026 Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) share price is up over $400 in a year. Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) has gone from $1.66 to over $35 in that same time period. Nio (NYSE:NIO) surged from $3.60 to $34. Facedrive (OTCMKTS:FD) shares have more than doubled. Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) gained nearly 600% in 2020 alone. And we\u2019re just getting started. Double the money is set to pour into this sector from the Biden administration. That\u2019s fantastic news for investors who\u2019ve gone green. It looks like Canadian Facedrive (TSXV:FD,OTC:FDVRF), saw the ESG trend before it went mega, and swooped in with a series of acquisitions over the past year designed to leverage the power of tech-driven eco-friendly verticals that could help to reshape the world. They used 2020 to solidify their presence in various initiatives from pioneering EV-focused ride-sharing and food delivery to disruptive EV car subscriptions--across North America. They\u2019re even aiming to be pioneers on the frontlines of the pandemic with proprietary contact tracing technology and wearables that could help get Canadians back to work, safely. With shares surging over 550% in the past year, Facedrive may be getting ready to kick things into overdrive. The Boom Before the Boom: Facedrive Was There First The ESG boom was on even before Biden came to office. Try as it might, the Trump administration could not staunch the inevitable flow of money into ESG. Sustainable investing became the biggest buzzword on Wall Street, and its leader--Black Rock--became the king of the cause. It\u2019s all about money. Lack of sustainability is now a risk that shareholders don\u2019t want to shoulder. Money managers appear to have seen the light of day. BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, plans to have $1.2 trillion in ESG assets within the next 10 years. And it\u2019s estimated that 1/3 of all assets under management in the U.S. are already sustainably invested... That\u2019s potentially $17.1 trillion invested in the companies making giant steps to put people and the planet first. Facedrive (TSXV:FD,OTC:FDVRF) saw the trend before most. It brought electric vehicles to its ridesharing business, in an industry which has been surprisingly bad for rising carbon emissions. With Facedrive, their customers have the choice of hailing a ride from an electric, hybrid, or gas-powered vehicle, all without paying an extra premium for the option. And after they arrive at their final stop, the in-app algorithm calculates the carbon footprint of each journey and a portion of the fare is set aside to plant trees, offsetting part of the carbon footprint from the ride. With the help of next-gen technology and partnerships, they\u2019re making it easier for customers to make more eco-friendly choices. And they\u2019re working with local authorities--not against them--to bolster business. In its biggest move late last year, Facedrive acquired Steer, a subscription-based ride sharing company that offers electric vehicles, from the largest clean energy producer in the United States--giant Exelon. Steer\u2019s ride sharing subscription model, which includes EVs, is aiming to challenge traditional car ownership by making it so easy \u2026 so seamless \u2026 and so affordable for users to have their own virtual showroom of EVs delivered to their door-step, on-demand. It was the perfect fit for Facedrive, which is already aiming to be a fierce competitor to Uber in certain ridesharing markets. Now, it plans to compete with car dealerships at large in both the U.S. and Canada. But with ESG companies seeing a record year in 2020, the markets are already looking forward to what the rest of this year holds. 2021: The Calm Before the ESG Storm ESG funds are still breaking money inflow records, even as markets pause for breath ahead of the big Biden breakout. ESG-focused companies are seeing higher returns, stronger earnings growth and bigger dividends. It\u2019s all about investment performance. That\u2019s why global ESG assets under management (AUM) grew from $6 billion in 2015 to $150 billion in 2020. There looks to be no stopping this march forward. Big money just seems to keep getting bigger. Morgan Stanley has committed to mobilizing $1 trillion by 2030 for sustainable solutions to climate change. And that\u2019s on top of the $1 trillion target some analysts are putting on ESG investments. Armando Senra, head of BlackRock\u2019s iShares America, says ESG funds will have raked in over $21 billion just in Q1 2021--almost the same it pulled in over the entire year in 2019. Senra says ESG could become a $1-trillion category by 2030, noting to CNBC that \u201cwe\u2019re just at the very beginning\u201d of what could be a decade-long growth story. With a new green president at the helm, ESG-focused companies may start reaping some of the benefits for their shareholders, in a big way. We think Facedrive\u2019s business model looks set to benefit from these ESG tailwinds. And it doesn't hurt that they\u2019ve made strategic alliances and investments in content companies for A-list celebrities like Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith\u2026 a company founded by Super Bowl-winning quarterback Russell Wilson\u2026 In just the last year, Facedrive (TSXV:FD,OTC:FDVRF) has struck important partnerships with all of them\u2026 These relationships could help them expand their business into the U.S. and push their eco-friendly mission ahead with apps, apparel, and more. With names like these getting onboard, it\u2019s proving that the ESG boom has gone far beyond just a few people buying electric vehicles. It\u2019s becoming a lifestyle shift that will touch nearly all areas of our economy. Now, they have a relationship with Exelon, too, thanks to their acquisition of Steer, which included a $2-million strategic investment by Exelon\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, Exelorate Enterprises, LLC. Facedrive On the Frontlines of the Pandemic Supporting the health of North America\u2019s citizens during these unprecedented times is paramount. Getting them back to work safely is critical to the economy. That\u2019s pushed many ESG-focused companies like Facedrive, to take a more hands on approach to COVID-19. Early last year, Facedrive partnered up with the University of Waterloo and MT>Ventures to create TraceSCAN, a wearable technology used for contact tracing. It offers an innovative approach to tracking that doesn\u2019t rely on cell phones. That could cover massive groups of people previously left without reliable contact tracing solutions to stop the spread... Children, senior citizens, low-income individuals, and employees not able to use phones on the job. And Facedrive has signed agreements with both the government of Ontario and Canada\u2019s largest airline, Air Canada, aiming to implement this technology. So, 2020 was the tipping point of the ESG boom. A \u201cgreen president\u201d has tipped it with a proposed multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure pledge that is ESG all the way. Unsurprisingly, some analysts are now predicting this will \u201cusher in an unprecedented boom for ESG investments\u201d and we think Facedrive could have some big opportunities in 2021 as a result. The ESG Boom Has Arrived Renewable energy providers are some of the top picks for ESG investors, but few have performed as well as Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH). Enphase Energy is a leading global supplier of microinverters and solar panels. They have been at the forefront of solar innovation, bringing new technology to market faster than any other company in the industry. The Enphase IQ 7+ system includes an innovative self-learning algorithm that monitors every module on your roof for performance optimization, ensuring you get more from your installation day after day, year after year. Enphase's sleek design makes installing their efficient solar solutions easy for homeowners by simplifying wiring and eliminating the need for bulky junction boxes or expensive mounting racks. Despite the tough first half of the year, however, Enphase has remained a favorite on Wall Street. Year-to-date, Enphase has seen its share price rise by leaps and bounds. And it\u2019s only just getting started. As the renewable push kicks into high gear, and with the United States expected to spend over $1.7 trillion on green energy initiatives over the next decade, Enphase might just emerge as one of the biggest winners. NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is another shining star in the renewable world. They have a wide range of products and services for both residential and commercial customers. One of their key offerings is solar power which has been growing at an exponential rate over the past few years due to global climate change initiatives. NextEra Energy works with many different companies like Apple, Amazon, Nestle Waters North America among others to help them become more sustainable by investing in renewable energy sources as well as helping them reduce their carbon footprint through providing quality products and services that lower utility bills. NextEra is the world\u2019s leading producer of wind and solar energy, so it\u2019s no surprise that it has received some love from the \u2018millennial dollar.\u2019 In fact, in 2018, the company was the number one capital investor in green energy infrastructure, and fifth largest capital investor across all sectors. No other company has been more active in reducing carbon emissions. And they\u2019re just getting started. By 2025, the company aims to reduce their own emissions by 67 percent while doubling their electricity production from a 2005 benchmark. To put this into perspective, if all of America\u2019s utilities were able to achieve NextEra Energy\u2019s projected 2025 emissions rate, absolute CO2 emissions for the power sector would be approximately 75% lower than they were in 2005. Not even the supermajors in the oil industry can ignore the ESG demand from investors. They\u2019ve been diversifying their portfolios to hedge their bets in the rapidly changing new reality of energy. And no other oil major takes this more seriously than Total (NYSE:TOT). Total has led the charge to go green. It is not only aware of the needs that are not being met by a significant portion of the world\u2019s growing population, it is also hyper-aware of the looming climate crisis if changes are not made. As such, Total is not only betting big on renewable energy, it is also doing its part in reducing emissions in its day-to-day activities. Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Total noted, \u201cIt\u2019s our job to meet growing energy needs while reducing carbon emissions.\u201d It's also one of the most conscious companies in the business. Total checks every box in the ESG checklist. It is promoting diversity and safety, making massive changes in its operations to ensure that its business is environmentally sound, and has even committed to going carbon neutral by 2050 or sooner. It\u2019s no surprise that shareholders are loving its forward-thinking approach. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) needs no introduction. It is the world\u2019s largest global investment management corporation, with over $7.4 trillion in assets under management. With clients in over 100 different countries, it is the de facto leader in its field. And just a few years ago, BlackRock underwent a major shift in its investment strategy, prioritizing stocks with high ESG ratings. BlackRock\u2019s focus on technology and sustainability has fueled the new trend in the marketplace, pushing even more investors to consciously consider where they put their money. There\u2019s a reason BlackRock is blowing Wall Street out of the water right now--sustainable investing. The new king of Wall Street recognized the trend well before the competition and bought into the sustainable investing ethos long ago and is now looking to take its sustainable portfolio from $90 billion to more than a trillion dollars. In June of last year, BlackRock even launched a new suite of funds focused on the ESG trend. The funds include; iShares ESG Aware Conservative Allocation ETF (EAOK); the iShares ESG Aware Moderate Allocation ETF (EAOM); the iShares ESG Aware Growth Allocation ETF (EAOR); and the iShares ESG Aware Aggressive Allocation ETF (EAOA). Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) is another way to capitalize on the EV hype. Despite being a bit late to jump on the sustainability train, Uber is finally making some changes in its operations. In late 2019, a scathing report about how much the ride-sharing giant was contributing to emissions emerged, suggesting that Uber and Lyft added as much as 70% more to global emissions than traditional alternatives prompting backlash among environmentalists. In fact, Uber even rolled out a new program to help drivers transition to electric vehicles. The $800 million \u2018Green Future\u2019 initiative, with the help of Chevrolet, allows drivers to get a near-$3000 discount on Bolt EV Premiers. Additionally, drivers of low-emission vehicles will also get a small bonus for every ride they complete. They will also get a discount on specific charging platforms to help cut costs during the transition. \u201cAs the largest mobility platform in the world, we know that our impact goes beyond our technology. We want to do our part to build back better and support a green recovery in our cities and communities,\u201d CEO Dara Khosrowshahi noted on the company\u2019s website. Canada\u2019s Silicon Valley is joining the ESG race, too. Shopify Inc (NASDAQ:SHOP; TSX:SH) is an absolute beast in the e-commerce world. In fact, because of its simple-to-use platform, it would be hard to have not stumbled onto a shop built with its technology. More than 1,000,000 businesses rely on Shopify\u2019s real-time e-commerce solutions, including Tesla, Budweiser and Red Bull, among many others. Shopify makes purchasing goods and services easy for anyone \u2013 and in a time where convenience is king, Shopify surely has staying power. In addition to its revolutionary approach on e-commerce, Shopify is also delving into blockchain technology, making it a promising pick for investors, especially given that the sector is red hot right now. Its clients are even able to accept bitcoin and a variety of other cryptocurrencies as payments with a few clicks. Global lockdowns accelerated Shopify\u2019s already-tremendous growth. Since March 2020 alone, Shopify has seen its price rise from just $495 per share to a high of $1800 per share before settling down to its current price. The company has already shown its potential, but as it continues to grow, so will its innovative solutions for businesses, and by extension, its share price. Shopify is one of the few e-commerce companies that may very well be able to compete with the likes of Amazon. Magna International (NYSE:MGA, TSX:MG) is an interesting roundabout way get in on the exciting resource and battery markets without betting big on one of the new unproven stocks captivating millennials right now. The six-decade-year-old manufacturing giant provides mobility technology for automakers of all types. From GM and Ford to luxury brands like BMW and Tesla, Magna is a master at striking deals. And it\u2019s clear to see why. The company has the experience and reputation that automakers are looking for. Over 10 years ago, Magna was already making major moves in the battery market, investing over half a billion dollars in battery production while the market was still in its infancy. At the time, electric vehicles as we know them had barely hit the scene, with Tesla launching its premiere car just two years prior. Magna\u2019s massive investment has paid if in a big way, however. Since its battery bet, the company has seen its valuation soar by tens of billions of dollars, and it has solidified itself as one of the leaders in the business. With the semiconductor industry in chaos, and another looming lithium and helium shortage, it will be interesting to see how Magna deals with these challenges. Maple Leaf Foods (TSX:MFI) is another veteran in the Canadian foods realm. Since 1991, Maple Leaf has been making aggressive acquisitions, supplying high-quality foods, and leading in new innovations to ensure the highest quality products for all of its consumers around Canada. And just last year, it announced its plans to dive head first into the plant-based foods industry with a $310 million facility in Shelbyville, Indiana. More than that, however, Maple Leaf Foods is also committed to slashing its own carbon footprint. In fact, on November 7, 2019, the company announced that it was the first major carbon-neutral food company \u2013 a huge claim to fame in a world racing to go green. The Very Good Food Company Inc. (CSE:VERY) is a Canadian company that is quickly gaining a lot of ground in the market. With the slogan, \u201cwe believe in butchering beans, not animals,\u201d they\u2019re looking to tap into the plant-based niche in a hurry. And it\u2019s resonated very well with investors. Since its IPO in June, the Very Good Food Company has seen its share price grow by over 70%, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing. In just a few short months, the company has opened several new facilities, signed a string of deals, and is quickly carving out its place in Canada\u2019s fast-growing plant-based lifestyle scene. GreenPower Motor (TSX:GPV) is a promising young electric bus manufacturer. Currently, its focus is primarily on the North American market, but it has plenty of room to grow as the industry takes off. Founded over a decade ago, GreenPower has been on the frontlines of the electric movement, manufacturing affordable battery-electric busses and trucks. From school busses to long-distance public transit, GreenPower\u2019s impact on the sector can\u2019t be ignored. Year-to-date, GreenPower Motor has seen its share price soar from $2.03 to $24.45.

Ford Motor Co, Nissan Motor Co Ltd, LG Corp, Samsung and start-ups Britishvolt and InoBat Auto are in talks with the British government or local authorities about locations for potential factories and financial support, according to the report. (https://on.ft.com/3wu1eYz) The British government's plan to prohibit the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030 and hybrids by 2035 will require the country's vehicle plants to shift to producing electric models. A UK business department spokesperson said \"to support the auto sector\u2019s transition to electric vehicles\" the government is \"dedicated to securing gigafactories, and continue to work closely with investors and vehicle manufacturers to progress plans to mass produce batteries in the UK\". So far, there are 38 planned gigafactories across Europe, according to green lobby group Transport & Environment, with only Britishvolt's project being disclosed in the UK, the newspaper said. In early-stage talks with the British government, Ford has indicated it was exploring making batteries in the UK that would then be shipped to Turkey for use in a planned electric version of its Transit van, the Financial Times reported. Ford may make parts of battery modules in Britain before shipping them to Turkey for final work and installation, according to the report. Nissan's talks with the government about building a battery plant at its Sunderland manufacturing complex hinge on energy costs, the Financial Times said. LG and Samsung are both in early-stage talks with the UK government about investments, and the companies are only likely to proceed if they have deals with major car makers, the report added. An LG official said the company has been reviewing various countries for expansion, but has made no decisions yet. Nissan said it will continue to accelerate the process toward electrification, adding \"we have no further plans to announce at this time.\" The remaining companies did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

After shares of the TSX surpassed the 20,000 point mark, there has been a downward trend. Investors are looking for the growth that they enjoyed back in 2020. Sorry, but 2020 is over. We\u2019re getting back to normalcy, and that\u2019s a good thing. We\u2019re not there yet, but don\u2019t worry. There are still some cheap stocks I\u2019d buy today and never sell. But wait, why wouldn\u2019t you sell stocks? Isn\u2019t that the point? Not necessarily. If you find the right stocks, reinvesting over the long term means you can create substantial wealth and also enjoy passive income. This comes from dividend stocks. The more you invest, the more passive income you receive. And the best part? It doesn\u2019t sway or dip with the markets. It\u2019s steady as a rail. If you buy the right stock. So here are two cheap stocks that offer this solid income. Each also offers substantial growth at a cheap price so you never have to sell until it\u2019s absolutely necessary. At first glance, the stock market looks like a scary place right now. But there are areas of the market offering discounts for those who buy now. Cheap stocks can be found especially in two sectors: tech and clean energy. And what\u2019s more, you can actually find dividend stocks in both sectors. Both areas have seen a pullback over the last few months. Tech stocks climbed during the pandemic, but investors worried about what the post-pandemic would mean for revenue. Then there\u2019s renewable energy, which saw sky-high prices when United States President Joe Biden took office. But again, investors wanted their earnings. So while there might be some short-term volatility over the next few years, don\u2019t worry. These cheap stocks will also deliver strong dividends. Clean energy companies are some of the best investments around today. If you can find real estate investment trusts that own multiple energy assets, even better. And that\u2019s why my first choice would be to buy up Brookfield Renewable Partners (TSX:BEP.UN)(NYSE:BEP) right now. Cheap stocks in the energy sector offer strong long-term returns. The world is shifting to clean energy, with an estimated $10 trillion being put into clean energy assets around the world over the next decade. President Biden has committed to putting billions into the sector as well, which is why shares climbed back in January. Shares climbed 85% between June 2020 and January 2021, but have since slumped by 11%. Now, shares are slowly starting to climb back up, creating a short opportunity to buy. Right now you can pick up shares for $48, that\u2019s trading at 2.2 times book value. A steal if I ever saw one. What\u2019s more, the proof is in the past for this stock. Shares are up 2,386% in the last two decades. That\u2019s a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.42%! And you can now lock in a dividend yield of 2.51%. It doesn\u2019t get much better than that. Like Brookfield, Open Text (TSX:OTEX)(NASDAQ:OTEX) has had a wild ride this last year. Shares crashed by 35% back in October, then quickly rallied to stabilize. To date, we\u2019re really almost exactly where we were a year ago with Open Text stock. But that\u2019s what makes this still one of the best cheap stocks around in my book. Open Text is one of the few tech stocks with a strong past and a strong future. The company has been growing through acquisitions for decades. But today it\u2019s now working on partnerships. Open Text has seen companies like Alphabet buy up its cloud security services, creating substantial revenue for future shareholders. Similar to Brookfield, the stock has been a multi-bagger over the last two decades. Shares are up 1,356% during that time, and it\u2019s why the company is likely now offering dividends to investors. It\u2019s done the investment and buying and is now able to share some of its wealth. You simply do not get that from tech stocks. Today you can pick up Open Text stock for trading at 3.3 times book value, a CAGR of 14%, and a dividend yield of 1.61%. By holding this stock for decades, you\u2019re bound to see future growth beyond your wildest dreams. The post 2 Cheap Stocks I\u2019d Buy Now and Never Sell appeared first on The Motley Fool Canada.

While hospitals have been using UV-C lights for decades to disinfect operating rooms, the technology was not widely adopted because the machinery was expensive, said Ben Boyer, a co-founder of R-Zero. R-Zero, formed in April last year, makes its UV-C light banks on wheels in San Jose. The company said it has booked $15 million in sales to schools, restaurants, senior care facilities, sports arenas and jails, through a subscription model that starts at $17 a day. It plans to unveil a suite of sensors and a small, safe UV-C light machine that turns on automatically when people are in the room, an improvement over its current UV-C light product that turns off when someone enters the room. The company uses software to collect the data and automate the whole process, said Boyer. Boyer said he is confident that a pirate or legacy UV-C maker could not compete with R-Zero even if it was able to replicate some of the company's devices. \u201cSystems are very hard to copy,\" he said. Ira Ehrenpreis an early investor in Tesla Inc and SpaceX who first invested in R-Zero last year, said technology is disrupting the cleaning industry. \u201cThe idea of taking an approach that has been terrible for our planet and equally terrible for the applicators or the folks that have not had a voice to speak up for themselves\u201d and eliminating the chemicals from it, said Ehrenpreis, fit with the goal of his venture capital firm DBL Partners. The latest round brings the total raised by R-Zero to $58 million. It was led by Silicon Valley venture capital firm World Innovation Lab.

But weak carbon dioxide (CO2) emission rules for car sales across the European Union and the UK in the near term risk undermining what is shaping up to be a booming battery manufacturing industry in Europe, a clean transport campaign group has warned.\u00a0\u00a0 While the EU has stronger car-emission rules for 2030 and beyond, it lacks similarly strong regulations for the next few years\u2014for 2025-2027. This could turn Europe\u2019s battery boom into a missed opportunity and could waste US$32.7 billion in investment because battery capacity would outstrip demand from electric vehicles (EVs), by a lot, according to a new analysis from Transport & Environment (T&E). Essentially, if the EU and the UK do not strengthen their CO2 rules for cars with targets to 2025 and 2029, even the battery factories that have already lined up full funding could end up being underutilized due to lower EV demand.\u00a0 Sure, EV sales in Europe boomed last year, and Europe even dethroned China as the top EV growth market, data from EV-volumes.com has shown.\u00a0 \u201cMany European markets have doubled or tripled their EV sales vs 2019 and Europe captured 43 % of global EV sales in 2020 vs 26 % in 2019,\u201d EV-volumes.com said.\u00a0\u00a0 Still, the weak EU standard 2025-2029 means carmakers do not have to substantially increase production and sales of electric cars until 2030, Transport & Environment said in its analysis.\u00a0\u00a0 If the CO2 car emission rules for the middle and end of this decade are left as-is, Europe\u2019s overall demand for battery cells could be just 174 GWh in 2025, rising to 485 GWh in 2030 when a more ambitious CO2 standard finally enters into force, Transport & Environment noted.\u00a0 At the same time, 17 factories\u2014including Tesla\u2019s gigafactory in Berlin\u2014have secured funding to date, and they are estimated to have cell production of 318 GWh in 2025. The battery capacity surplus compared to expected demand with current CO2 rules is enormous. \u201cThe surplus problem is most acute in the mid-to-late-2020s peaking at 227 GWh in 2026. Raising the 2030 CO2 standard only will do nothing to solve this problem,\u201d according to Transport & Environment.\u00a0 Related: Oil Could Reach $80 This Summer, But There\u2019s A Catch \u201cThe battery industry is successfully responding to Europe\u2019s e-mobility ambitions, yet EU policy-makers are failing to provide regulatory certainty and guarantee an adequate market for electric vehicles. The EU and UK must raise CO2 standards throughout the decade to avoid wasting billions of investments and derailing the battery boom,\u201d said Julia Poliscanova, senior director for vehicles and e-mobility at T&E.\u00a0 \u201cBattery manufacturing is the most valuable part of the EV supply chain and with China and the US also pumping huge amounts of cash into battery making, Europe\u2019s wasted investments this decade will be nothing compared to the opportunity missed this century,\u201d Poliscanova added.\u00a0 Some countries already have targets to phase out new gasoline and diesel sales. The UK, for example, banned last year the sale of new fossil-fueled cars from 2030.\u00a0 The EU is set to propose new targets for CO2 rules for passenger cars and vans next month when the bloc is expected to further strengthen its climate policies to align them to a pathway to net-zero emissions in 2050.\u00a0 \u201cThe conclusion is clear: the current EV regulations are underselling Europe\u2019s battery potential,\u201d Transport & Environment said, calling for more aggressive EU policies in the near term. These could include raising the 2025 CO2 reduction target to 25 percent and setting an additional target of 40 percent reduction for 2027 to solve the expected battery cell overcapacity, T&E said.\u00a0 By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com\u00a0 More Top Reads From Oilprice.com: Russia Expands Its Influence In Major Iraqi Oil Fields China\u2019s Oil Imports To Drop After Refinery Margins Near $0 The Renewable Energy Revolution Has A Major Employment Problem Read this article on OilPrice.com "}, {"source": "Yahoo Finance", "title": "3 Top Stocks From the Thriving Business Information Industry ", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-stocks-thriving-business-124412962.html", "date": "Fri, 11 Jun 2021 12:44:12 GMT", "content": "Increased adoption and success of the work-from-home trend is enabling the Zacks Business \u2013 Information Services industry to cater to the pandemic-driven rising demand for services that ensure risk mitigation, cost reduction and productivity improvement.

If implemented, Norway could see taxes levied for the first time on electric cars from luxury automakers such as Porsche, Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz, as well as high-end Tesla and Audi models. Seeking to become the first nation to end the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2025, oil-producing Norway currently exempts all fully electric vehicles from the taxes imposed on internal combustion engines. As a result, 54% of all new cars sold in Norway last year were powered by batteries only, a global record, up from 42% in 2019 and a mere 1% a decade ago. But the policy comes at a substantial cost, estimated by the ruling centre-right coalition at 19.2 billion Norwegian crowns ($2.32 billion) in lost state revenue last year, or some 250,000 crowns on average for each new electric car sold. The more expensive a car is, the bigger the sales tax and other levies foregone by the state, thus giving the biggest implied subsidies to high-income households while also raising the cost per tonne of carbon emissions saved, the paper found. \"Norway could improve the targeting of its tax incentives to increase their environmental impact,\" the paper by three IMF economists concluded. One such targeted change could be to offer subsidies to actually scrap petrol and diesel cars when replaced by EVs, the economists said, adding that Norway should also consider raising the taxes imposed on polluting cars. The proposals could resonate well with Norway's centre-left opposition, which is favoured to win power in national elections due in September. While supporting the goal of selling only EVs by 2025, Norway's Labour and other centre-left parties all want to start imposing sales taxes on the portion of a car's cost that exceeds 600,000 crowns. For comparison, the least expensive model of an electric Porsche costs 758,000 crowns, while the top model starts at 1.7 million crowns, according to the automaker's website.

Related: Market Wrap: Attempts to Push Bitcoin Above $40K Stall However, macro and crypto-specific factors including the impending U.S. Federal Reserve meeting, bitcoin\u2019s dominance rate and technical charts warrant caution on the part of the bulls.\u00a0 Let take a look at these factors in detail. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss policy. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference following the meeting at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday. While the central bank is likely to keep key policy tools unchanged, some analysts are concerned the bank may strike a slightly less dovish tone in the wake of rising inflation.\u00a0 Related: Most Fund Managers Say Bitcoin Still in a Bubble: Bank of America Survey \u201cWhile we think that most Fed members will be determined to keep interest rates on hold until they see signs of a sustained increase in prices, we also expect a handful of voting members to upgrade their interest rate projections over the forecast period,\u201d Matthew Ryan, a senior market analyst at the global fintech and FX risk-management firm Ebury, said.\u00a0 \u201cThis is likely to result in a median dot that shows hikes before the end of 2023 versus the March projections that signaled no hikes until 2024,\u201d Ryan said.\u00a0 According to crypto finance service provider Amber Group, there are some concerns the Fed may discuss the timeline for paring down, or tapering, the liquidity-boosting emergency stimulus launched a year ago. That\u2019s evident from the pre-Fed weak tone in gold, copper, and other commodities, as noted by Bloomberg.\u00a0 Any hint of early tapering or a rate hike could trigger risk aversion in financial markets, killing the nascent bitcoin recovery. Alternatively, a strongly worded commitment to keep the tap open would bring cheer to bitcoin and asset prices in general.\u00a0 Prominent investors like Barry Silbert, co-founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group (CoinDesk\u2019s parent company), expect a pickup in the equity market volatility after the Fed meeting. Some of that could feed into the bitcoin market. \u201cI\u2019ve gone long the VIX to prepare for the macro fireworks,\u201d Silbert tweeted Monday, referring to the Cboe Volatility Index.\u00a0 \u201cFundamentally, we still see downside risk [for bitcoin] associated with a correction in the extended U.S. equities and downside risk associated with regulatory headwinds,\u201d Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital, said.\u00a0 A sustained uptick in bitcoin\u2019s dominance rate \u2013 the top cryptocurrency\u2019s share in the total market capitalization \u2013 is needed to confirm a trend reversal higher.\u00a0 That\u2019s because the largest cryptocurrency by market value is usually the first to rally, followed by alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins). In other words, money enters the crypto world through bitcoin, as seen in October 2020, and moves to altcoins.\u00a0 The dominance rate remains below 50% at press time, having peaked above 70% in early January, according to TradingView. According to analysts at JPMorgan, that bitcoin\u2019s share is still quite low is a bearish sign.\u00a0 \u201cWe believe that the share of bitcoin in the total crypto market would have to normalize and perhaps rise above 50% (as in 2018) to be more comfortable in arguing that the current bear market is behind us,\u201d JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a note published June 9. Also read: MicroStrategy Raises $500M From Bond Sale to Buy More Bitcoin \u2013 CoinDesk Matthew Dibb, co-founder and COO of Stack Funds, said he expects bitcoin\u2019s share in the crypto market to rise in the coming weeks. \u201cWith the rotation from altcoins to bitcoin, as well as the imminent purchase of large tranches of Bitcoin by MicroStrategy, we may see the dominance rate grind higher in the next few weeks, while altcoins lag.\u201d While bitcoin has charted an impressive relief rally to $40,000, it has yet to clear key price hurdles that could pave the way for bullish revival. \u201cIdeally, for us to call a bottom we would like to see a weekly close above $41,000,\u201d Stack Funds\u2019 Dibb said.\u00a0 Simon Peters, a crypto asset analyst at multi-asset investment platform eToro, also cited $41,000 as the level to beat. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the price face resistance earlier in the year at this level when it was trading around what was then an all-time high, and I would need to see a stronger increase to feel optimistic about the price recovering and possibly pushing onto $50,000 and beyond,\u201d Peters said in an email.\u00a0 Bitcoin briefly topped $41,000 on Monday before falling back to under $40,000, CoinDesk 20 data shows.

President Biden has already committed to spending $174 billion on boosting the electric vehicle market. Every major car company on earth is now pursuing its own EV project. And demand for electric vehicles is soaring around the globe as governments race to reduce emissions. In the last year alone: Tesla\u2019s stock price soared by 256%... Chinese EV giant NIO handed investors an incredible 816% return... And GM saw its stock price jump 211% as it pivoted towards electric vehicles. The only real headache for investors looking to get in on the hottest sector of the year is figuring out which of these EV stocks have the most upside potential. And when it comes to identifying upside potential, it is always best to focus on the potentially disruptive companies that are yet to grab the headlines\u2026 An obvious candidate for those familiar with the EV space is Fisker (NYSE:FSR). This up-and-coming EV maker has an asset-light business model that means it can specialize in one thing and one thing only - building EVs. Its recent deal with Foxconn is a clear sign that Fisker means business, and its first car should be coming to market in late 2022. Another potential disruptive stock to watch in 2021 related to the EV industry is Facedrive (TSXV:FD; OTC:FDVRF), a little-known Canadian startup that is attempting to connect the EV industry with the multi-trillion-dollar subscription service industry. And it doesn\u2019t stop there, Facedrive is also competing in the ride-sharing and food delivery space with its zero-emissions or carbon reduced EV-focused services. Finally, with Biden determined to kickstart a major infrastructure renovation in the U.S., Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) has plenty of blue-sky potential in the future. The company provides EV charging equipment and networked EV charging services across the U.S. and is sure to win big regardless of which EV giant eventually dominates the industry. Anything EV and EV Related Is Golden Right Now In 2021, we think you really can\u2019t go wrong in the EV space. The $40-trillion energy transition is well and truly underway, and transportation is at the very heart of this global shift. But as Elon Musk picks fights with everyone from the SEC to the entire cryptocurrency community, while short sellers continue to target the biggest name in the EV space, it is clear that Tesla is slowly losing its appeal. For investors looking for a pure-EV play that could outperform Tesla in the coming year, Fisker has all of the pull that Tesla did when it was first starting out. And once Fisker hits production, it is going to be dealing with far fewer overheads and problems than Elon Musk\u2019s ever-expanding car giant has. Fisker\u2019s recent deal with Foxconn, the Taiwanese company that assembles iPhones, has investors very excited indeed - with the partnership aiming to produce an exciting new electric vehicle by the end of 2023. For a stock that is trading at slightly over $10, the upside is undeniable. The only caveat--which is exactly what makes this a great time to get in early--is that Fisker isn\u2019t going to start producing its famed Ocean SUV until late 2022, with significant revenues coming in from advance orders not expected until late 2021.That means this is a long-term hold, and one that plenty of Wall Street appears not to have enough patience for. But the bearishness on Fisker reminds us an awful lot of the prior relentless bearishness on Tesla, and we all know how that went. Now, if you are doubtful that newcomers to the EV market can compete with the likes of Tesla, GM, and Volkswagen, then there are plenty of other exciting ways to play the EV boom. Facedrive - one of the most fascinating companies to come out of Canada\u2019s \u2018Silicon Valley\u2019 in a long time - is approaching the EV market in a very different way. Its flagship carbon-offset ride-sharing and food delivery service has already proven to be popular, but now it is moving into the fast growing subscription industry. The thesis here is that we aren\u2019t just living through the golden age of EVs \u2026 we are living through a transformation of how we as humans interact with our planet. Facedrive (TSXV:FD; OTC:FDVRF), which describes itself as a \u2018planet and people first\u2019 company, is viewing the EV industry as just one part of a much larger formula. And it has a knack for spotting great deals and acquiring innovative, well-placed companies to fit into their ecosystem. Its acquisition of Steer, which took place in September 2020, is what really excited EV analysts about this company. Steer is a subscription company that gives consumers their own private virtual EV showroom where they can select the car they want to drive each month. It is a new way to look at car use and a format that will make EVs accessible to an entirely new set of consumers. With Steer, you get to drive a collection of the best EVs on the market, with scenarios for a range of budgets and tastes. No added insurance necessary. No maintenance. No hassle whatsoever. It\u2019s the best in on-demand concierge services, and we fully expect it to transform the industry. Even more excitingly, Steer was part of the $40B market cap energy giant Exelon (NYSE:EXC). So the big names are already interested in what could become the next big EV vertical to watch in our ever-changing world Finally, no matter who wins the EV war in the end, the real winners in this space are the charging companies that get to take advantage of all that extra demand. If you are looking for a long-term hold, then Blink Charging is a no-brainer for investors who believe the U.S. will soon have a charging station at every gas station in the U.S. Biden has made it clear that he wants to pump $2 trillion into renewable energy infrastructure, and nothing speaks to EV infrastructure right now like charging does. Blink owns, operates, and provides EV charging equipment and networked EV charging services in the United States. It\u2019s not a new company \u2026 it\u2019s been biding its time, and that time is now. That\u2019s why its shares have soared from $3 to over $30 in the last year. Each of these companies has plenty of upside right now in an industry that is going from strength to strength, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t also win big by betting on some of the sector\u2019s more traditional players. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) may have seen its stock price fall over the past month as inflation fears grow and Elon Musk continues to be his controversial self, but this EV and clean energy giant is going to do well in the energy transition. It is still worth more than half a trillion dollars, more than the top three American automakers--GM, Ford and Chrysler\u2014 combined. Tesla\u2019s stock has skyrocketed by over 14,000% since it first released the Tesla Roadster in 2008. And it\u2019s not just about cars, either. Musk is looking towards a much bigger picture, building the foundation for an electrified future on all fronts. So while competition may be heating up in the EV space, it is likely to see revenue increasing across the board as energy storage and clean energy teach continues to boom. The main threat to Tesla\u2019s global dominance, however, appears to be coming from China. Just a year ago, no one could have imagined how successful the NIO Limited (NYSE:NIO) was going to be. In fact, many shareholders were ready to write off their losses and give up on the company. But China\u2019s answer to Tesla has outperformed even the most ambitious forecasts and somehow managed to keep its balance sheet in line. And it\u2019s paid off. In a big way. The company saw its share price soar from $3.24 at the start of 2020 to a high of $61 in February, representing a massive 1600% return for investors who held strong. The Chinese giant then suffered major losses in March as inflation fears combined with weaker than expected earnings and a shortage in semi-conductors to send the stock tumbling by nearly 50%. But it now appears to have stabilized and the future remains bright for a company producing in a country where EV demand is set to soar in the coming decade. The EV up-and-comer turned things around before, notably following its rumored potential bankruptcy in 2019, and it would be a brave investor who bets against them to do it again. NIO\u2019s CEO, William Li, is as skilled and ambitious as anyone in the business. Li Automotive (NASDAQ:LI) is the newest Chinese electric vehicle darling. Founded just five years ago by Li Xiang, and backed by domestic investment giants Meituan and Bytedance, Li has taken a different approach to the electric vehicle market. Li specializes in plug-in hybrid vehicles. This means it can be powered by electricity or gasoline, or a mixture of both, giving customers a wider array of fueling options compared to its competitors. Its fashionable crossover SUV has been a hit in China, and thanks to its success, its garnered a lot of investor interest. Since going public on the NASDAQ in July, the company has seen its share price more than double. Especially in the past month. It\u2019s already worth more than $30 billion but many are saying that it is just getting started. With estimates suggesting that there could be as many as 125 million electric vehicles on the road in the next ten years, and a growing call to ban gasoline-powered cars, companies like Li are sure to grow exponentially. When it comes to charging stations, Blink Charging isn\u2019t the only player in the game. Billionaires couldn\u2019t keep their hands off Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) this year, with giant BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink piling in heavily, alongside other heavy hitters. Why? Partly because Plug Power is already providing its hydrogen-powered tech solutions to big-name retailers, but overall, because the green revolution is clearly happening and unfolding as we speak. It helps that Plug's full-year guidance implies year-on-year sales growth of around 35%, even if profit won\u2019t come for a while. Morgan Stanley's Stephen Byrd believes green hydrogen will become economically viable quicker than investors appreciate saying Plug Power's deal with Apex Clean Energy to develop a green hydrogen network using wind power offers a chance to tap into \"very low cost\" renewable power and helps accelerate the shift to clean energy. Plug has a goal for over 50% of its hydrogen supplies to be generated from renewable resources by 2024. Facedrive isn\u2019t the only exciting EV related stock in Canada, either. GreenPower Motor (TSX:GPV) produces larger-scale electric transportation and is grabbing plenty of attention. Right now, it is primarily focused on the North American market, but the sky is the limit as the pressure to go green grows. GreenPower has been on the frontlines of the electric movement, manufacturing affordable battery-electric busses and trucks for over ten years. From school busses to long-distance public transit, GreenPower\u2019s impact on the sector is undeniable. Year-to-date, GreenPower Motor has seen its share price soar from $2.03 to a yearly high of $43.62. Just like most companies in this space, inflation fears and semiconductor shortages sent the stock tumbling in 2021, but the upside here is undeniable as the EV revolution kicks into high gear. NFI Group (TSX:NFI) is another one of Canada\u2019s premier electric bus producers. Though it has not yet rebounded to its January highs, NFI still offers investors a promising opportunity to capitalize on the electric vehicle boom at a discount. In addition to its increasingly positive financial reports, it is also one of the few in the business that actually pays dividends out to its investors. This is huge because it gives investors an opportunity to gain exposure to this booming industry while the stock is cheap and hold steady until the market finally discovers this gem. Westport Fuel Systems (TSX:WPRT) is a unique way to get in on the green boom in the auto industry. It helps build the tools needed for carmakers to incorporate less damaging fuels like natural gas. Though natural gas doesn\u2019t get quite the attention as electric vehicles do, there are over 22.5 million natural gas vehicles on the road across the globe. And that market is expected to grow as the energy transition really takes off. Speaking of the energy transition, Canadian companies are winning big in this realm as well. Telecom giant Shaw Communications Inc (TSE:SJR.B) is a great example. Shaw is taking a leadership role among Canadian companies in its use of renewable energy. Though its telecom business is its primary focus, it\u2019s betting big on the energy transition as well, holding a stake in renewable projects across the country. In fact, it is one of the biggest customers of Bullfrog Power which sources its electricity from a blend of wind energy and hydropower. BCE Inc. (TSX:BCE) is a household name in Canada. Everyone knows the company and knows what it is about. For the past 25 years, BCE has been at the forefront of the environmental movement. Their environmental management system (EMS) has been certified to be ISO 14001-compliant since 2009. Throughout its push into the position of one of Canada\u2019s top telco groups, it has bought and sold a number of different firms. That\u2019s great news for the company and its investors. When it comes to the energy transition, there are a million different ways to play the boom, but if you want to maximize the upside of the EV boom - there are really 3 stocks to watch. By.

Interest in zero-emission aircraft that take off and land like helicopters but fly like planes is growing as aerospace companies look for new markets and face pressure to help decarbonize their industry though the battery-operated vehicles. Maker's debut, staged at a hangar using XR technology to simulate a ride, followed news on Thursday of two separate deals involving electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft companies based in Britain and Brazil. Archer's aircraft does not yet fly commercially but it mounted an extravagant show under a new chief creative officer who has decades of experience in experiential design and television production, Kenny Taht, to attract attention. Archer expects Maker's commercial launch in 2024 in Los Angeles and Miami and is in the process of certifying the piloted four-passenger aircraft with the Federal Aviation Administration, co-founder and co-CEO Brett Adcock told Reuters. \"Our real goal is to make a mass market transportation solution in and around cities,\" Adcock said. The taxis can fly at 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour) for distances up to 60 miles (100km) at an entry level price between $3 and $4 per passenger mile. In New York City for example, the 17-mile trip from John F. Kennedy International Airport to Manhattan would cost $50 to $70 and take around five to seven minutes versus 60 to 90 minutes in a car. While experts estimate the eVTOL market to be worth billions over the next decade, it is not expected to immediately make money and the timing of regulatory approval remains uncertain. Asked about the approval process, the FAA said: \"The FAA can certify new technologies such as eVTOLs through its existing regulations. We may issue special conditions or additional requirements, depending on the type of project.\" As the market heats up, so has competition. Archer is currently embroiled in a legal battle with Boeing-backed competitor Wisk Aero, which has accused it of stealing trade secrets and infringing on its patents. Archer last week asked a California court to dismiss the lawsuit and courtersued Wisk for \"false statements\" regarding a separate criminal probe. Archer plans to go public through a $3.8 billion merger with blank-check company Atlas Crest and has an investment and $1 billion order from United Airlines.

The state-owned energy producer is making early preparations for the sale, according to the people, who asked not to to be identified because the information is private. The company hasn\u2019t yet started a formal process and could add more banks to work on the deal, they said. The deal may be structured similarly to Aramco\u2019s $12.4 billion oil pipeline deal, the people said. In that transaction, investors will own a minority stake in a new subsidiary that has leasing rights over the network, while Aramco will retain ownership of the oil pipelines and will continue to hold a majority stake in the subsidiary. The percentage of the stake up for sale is under discussion, the people said. Deliberations are at an early stage and there\u2019s no certainty the company will proceed with a transaction. Aramco and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Bloomberg reported in April that Aramco was considering selling part of its gas pipeline network in a deal that could raise billions of dollars depending on how the transaction is structured. The same month, Aramco said a consortium led by EIG Global Energy Partners LLC would invest in its oil pipelines. Aramco is offloading stakes in non-core assets to help maintain its $75 billion dividend, most of which goes to the Saudi government. The company is also planning to spend about $35 billion on capital expenditure this year. Aramco\u2019s Master Gas System is a network of pipelines connecting its production with processing sites throughout the kingdom.

The model is \"faster than any Porsche, safer than any Volvo,\" said Musk, wearing a black leather jacket, after he drove the Model S Plaid down a test track onto the stage. He said he expects to produce 1,000 a week next quarter. Ahead of the event, Tesla raised the price by $10,000 to $129,990 against $79,990 for a long-range Model S. \"The Model S has not been changing a lot in terms of looks over the past almost decade,\" said Jessica Caldwell, executive director at car information provider Edmunds. \"I think Tesla has to offer consumers something more ... like new and fun things.\" The launch of the Model S Plaid, which has already been showcased online, has faced delay and some controversy over an expected airplane-style yoke steering wheel. Musk canceled another variant, Model S Plaid+, which would have had a 33% higher driving range than the Model S Plaid and used advanced battery technology, known as 4680 cells. \"The Model S Plaid is definitely intended to help reduce the migration of current Tesla owners out of Tesla,\" said Ed Kim, vice president at consultancy AutoPacific. \"I think what we're seeing now is that Tesla can no longer operate in a vacuum.\" He said Model S Plaid is a low-volume, halo model aimed at showcasing the automaker and generating excitement around the sedan, with Tesla needing to successfully roll out new models like Cybertruck and Semi trucks to expand its customer base. Musk has called the Model S Plaid \"the fastest accelerating car ever.\" The more powerful sports sedan goes from zero to 60 miles per hour (97 kph) in 1.99 seconds and has an estimated driving range of 390 miles (627.6 km). While it offers little change in body style, the Plaid charges faster at Tesla supercharger stations, has a roomier back seat and an improved entertainment system, including what he said was the \"level of a PlayStation five.\" \"If we're thinking about the future where the car is often in autopilot to full self driving mode, then entertainment is going to become increasingly important. So you're going to want to watch movies, play games, use the internet...\" Tesla delivered only 2,020 Model S/Xs in the first quarter, down from 18,920 the previous quarter, hampered by production delays. Musk said in April that production of its new Model S and X would be \"contingent on global supply chain issues.\" Tesla shares rose 1.9% on Thursday ahead of the evening event.

What may be lying beneath the surface of this still impressive performance from the disruptors is that the old implicit rule for business \u2013 the alleged trade off between profitability and the environmental responsibility \u2013 is less true today than in the history of the auto sector. In the last decade, success in the auto sector was based less on improving environmental impacts of the products they built (most all the impact is from product use), and more based on the need to satisfy consumers\u2019 insatiable demand to go bigger \u2013 supersize me with an SUV (and let\u2019s not focus on the carbon footprint): And many of these gas-guzzling SUVs are still in the legacy OEM product pipelines and will be on the road for years to come. But, times are changing, driven largely by three realities. Climate change is really coming, faster than we thought and with more devastating consequences sooner than we thought. This is a reality defined by physics and chemistry, not politics. Second, electric vehicle drivers are finding EVs to be superior in just about every respect compared to fossil fuel driven vehicles. EVs are better, cleaner and becoming cheaper. According to a new study by researchers at the University of California Davis, four out of five EV drivers surveyed in California say they would not go back. The only flaws (range and charging) are rapidly being addressed. Third, regulators, most acutely in the EU, are making it increasingly costly for firms based or doing business there to delay transformation. Some of the auto majors saw this fact coming several years ago and began repositioning. They would no longer be able to externalise the harms of their products. Not only were the regulators getting serious, but an increasing number of buyers were finding a preferred alternative that didn\u2019t have those negative externalities. Volkswagen, the largest of the auto-sector mega-fauna, is perhaps the best example given its massive scale and current fleet, which is still 95% fossil fuel driven cars and SUVs. Recent announcements of R&D spend signal a seismic shift in priorities, with roughly 50% of spend ($86bn) over the next five years allocated to EVs and related technology. And VW has already seen rewards from the marketplace, with much of the return emerging alongside their EV plans. In addition to Volkswagen, there are what we at Signal Climate Analytics call legacy transition opportunity leaders (EU-based companies like Daimler, and BMW, which have had aggressive growth plans for EVs over the past two years), and risers (companies like Ford, Kia, Hyundai, which have recently made a major shift toward a more aggressive EV strategy). Both leaders and risers have seen a remarkable recovery in their shareholder performance, just as there has been a bit of a retrenchment among disruptors. In the accompanying graph we rank auto makers by \u201cSustainable Value Ratio\uf0e4\u201d or SVR. The SVR is a measure of the readiness of a firm to optimise opportunity and minimise risk in making the transition to lower carbon products and processes. The legacy leaders and risers (blue box below) are demonstrating, through a combination of skilled management and a motivated labour force, that they are prepared to go head to head with the disruptors. They are currently behind but have a real advantage in knowing how to scale up. With a level of customer enthusiasm for EVs strong among current owners, the recent big positive swings in shareholder value among legacy automakers poised to go big with EV production may be signalling that investors and analysts are now paying close attention to the readiness of automakers to optimise the coming EV opportunity, and minimise their fossil-fuel product risks. If that is indeed what we are seeing in these numbers, then this will be one of the first signals that the new business logic of growth and profitability through de-carbonization (innovations that deliver the customer value proposition with reduced environmental harms) is beginning to factor into the value assessments, as we are seeing in other carbon-intensive sectors like energy and utilities, which will also be key to auto sector decarbonisation. In boardrooms of the world\u2019s oldest and best-known legacy automakers, directors have watched in awe as this new generation of automotive \u2018disruptors\u2019, exemplified by Tesla, have seized the imagination and capital of seasoned investors and stock market enthusiasts alike. They have had the innovation lane all to themselves. But the automotive \u201cdinosaurs\u201d can now be spotted in the rear-view mirror of those disruptors. And they are catching up, with many now staking their claims to that same piece of the road. In the words of Jim Farley, Ford\u2019s CEO since 2019: \u201cThe electrification of the industry is a big change, and I think it wasn\u2019t clear until we launched Lightning and Mach E that Ford was going to be a winner in this new electric reality \u2026 Now investors are betting on Ford, and what they\u2019re telling me is, \u2018The strategy is attractive, Go execute it, Farley\u2019.\u201d Making an EV vehicle that draws raves from its drivers is becoming \u201cdoable\u201d for the transition leaders and risers among the legacy automakers. It may be that as EV production finally starts to take off several old companies will have a chance to become the new \u201cstory\u201d stocks, capturing a disproportionate share of the valuation gains with strategies that finally break the profit vs environment trade-off.

This can happen via various forms of cooperation,\" he said.

As part of that spending, the No. 1 U.S. automaker will build two additional U.S. battery plants and move ahead some of its EV investments, said the sources, who asked not to be identified. In November, GM upped its spending plans from $20 billion, a figure that was announced in March before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the auto industry.  The Detroit company declined to comment. In addition, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other key Democrats to discuss EVs and vehicle emissions, the sources said. Barra will also meet U.S. Representative Richard Neal, head of the tax policy Ways and Means Committee, Frank Pallone, who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee, and two key Michigan Democrats: Representatives Dan Kildee and Debbie Dingell, the sources said. WOOING WASHINGTON Working with Washington is critical as President Joe Biden has proposed $174 billion to boost EVs and charging as part of his infrastructure plan, including $100 billion in new EV rebates. GM's ability to benefit from the current $7,500 federal EV tax credit has expired. GM has sparred with Democrats over vehicle emissions rules, but last week said it supported overall emissions reductions in California's 2019 deal with other major automakers. It has also sought more flexibility to hit carbon reduction target between now and 2026. The Associated Press reported on Monday that GM planned to announce two new U.S. battery plants, citing comments by President Mark Reuss. GM confirmed the executive's comments, but sources said the company has not decided where in the United States to build the plants, which are each expected to cost more than $2 billion. GM confirmed in November it would speed up the rollout of new EVs, with plans to offer 30 models globally by 2025, up from a prior target of 20 by 2023. Barra said the automaker wants to exceed annual sales of 1 million EVs in the United States and China by 2025. The bill also includes a 30% tax credit for manufacturers to retool or build new facilities to produce advanced energy technologies including batteries.

Sweden\u2019s Volvo Cars is owned by Geely. The Polestar SUV will initially be sold in the United States, but could eventually be exported, Ingenlath said. Polestar, which was launched in 2017, sells the low-volume halo Polestar 1 hybrid performance car for about $155,000. Its first high-volume car, the Polestar 2, sells for about $60,000. Both cars are built in China. Ingenlath said last year Polestar was targeting annual Polestar 2 sales of more than 50,000 vehicles within two to three years.

Total crypto ouflows hit $21 million for the week ending June 11. Since mid-May, total outflows reached $267 million,  representing 0.6% of total assets under management (AUM). Ether, the token used in the Ethereum blockchain, posted its largest outflow last week of $12.7 million, data showed. The token has been one of the strongest performers this year. But CoinShares said ether inflows last week were mixed, \"implying mixed opinions among investors.\" Ether was last up 1% on the day at $2,536 . Since hitting a record $4,380.64 on May 12, ether has fallen 40%. The outflows in bitcoin cooled last week to $10 million, significantly lower than the previous record week of $141 million, CoinShares data showed. Trading activity in bitcoin products rose 43% from the previous week. While bitcoin is currently trading 36% below its 11-year exponential trend, Dan Morehead, co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, said in his Blockchain Letter on Monday that investors should resist the urge to close positions and instead go the other way if they have the emotional and financial resources to do so. \"Bitcoin generally goes way up...Anyone that has held bitcoin for 3.25 years has made money,\" said Morehead.

Perhaps the definitive sign that crypto for the masses has arrived and is here to stay is the fact that Bitcoin and Dogecoin whisperer, Elon Musk, recently hosted Saturday Night Live, which also parodied NFTs. Earlier this year, Tesla announced it was investing $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, adding momentum to a wave of corporate and institutional investments in cryptocurrencies. According to Gemini's recently released 2021 State of U.S. Crypto Report, more than 21 million adults own cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, and the number of crypto investors is projected to double this year. The rapid and widespread adoption of crypto and digital assets at the corporate, institutional and individual level is outpacing the existing legal frameworks that apply to digital assets, causing confusion and frustration for market participants. There are many legal and regulatory issues related to trading and investing in digital assets, including securities and commodities law concerns, custody issues, trading terms, know-your-customer and anti-money laundering requirements, reporting requirements, and intellectual property as well as tax and accounting issues. Regulations differ based on jurisdiction and, in some cases, the characteristics and use of a particular digital asset. In the United States, a threshold regulatory question for digital assets is whether the asset is a security or commodity. The rules for each category are different, as are the primary regulators, with securities being regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and derivatives related to commodities being regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The classification of digital assets as securities has wide-ranging implications for the regulatory obligations that flow from the offer, sale, trading and clearing of such assets. Platforms that bring together purchasers and sellers to trade digital assets that are securities in the United States are generally subject to registration as exchanges or alternative trading systems. Individuals or entities facilitating clearing and settlement of securities may be subject to registration with the SEC as a clearing agency, and individuals or entities that effect transactions in digital assets that are securities in the United States may be subject to registration with the SEC and in certain states as a \"broker\" or \"dealer.\" After registering, the individuals or entities would be subject to continued regulation by the SEC and applicable states. It is likely that many initial coin offerings (ICOs) will constitute offerings of securities under the prevailing \"Howey Test\" used by the SEC to determine whether digital assets constitute securities. In short, if the digital asset can be characterized as an investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others, it likely qualifies as a security under SEC precedents. Digital assets that constitute securities are subject to the applicable regulatory requirements for all publicly traded securities, including disclosure requirements and rules for public and private offering and selling, as well as investing and trading in, such digital assets. An important regulator to watch is former CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler who recently took the reins as SEC Chairman. Gensler has extensive expertise in this space and previously served as Co-Director of MIT's FinTech Initiative and Senior Advisor to the MIT Media Lab Digital Currency Initiative. Market watchers are eagerly awaiting the SEC's decision on whether to allow exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are linked to Bitcoin and other digital assets. If approved, such a move will exponentially increase both retail and institutional participation in the space. However, approval is far from certain, especially after Gensler testified before Congress in early May about how the crypto market \"could benefit from greater investor protection.\" The CFTC is the federal agency responsible for regulating U.S. commodity futures, option and swap markets. CFTC regulations will apply to digital assets that are not securities, depending on the type of product and the type of transaction conducted. Some digital assets, such as Bitcoin, were designed for the sole function of value exchange, while other digital assets facilitate transactions such as smart contracts or particular activities on purpose-built networks. For example, Ether via Ethereum allows for the payment of certain computation costs associated with executing smart contracts. Popular digital assets like Bitcoin and Ether are considered to be commodities from a regulatory perspective, and therefore futures, option, swap or other derivative transactions relating to those assets fall under the CFTC's jurisdiction. The CFTC generally does not regulate spot transactions in commodities, although such transactions are subject to CFTC prohibitions on fraud and manipulation. While some countries have a centralized agency that regulates (or potentially could regulate) all digital assets \u2014 for example, the UK Financial Conduct Authority \u2014 in the U.S. we have an \"alphabet soup\" of rules and regulators, each with a distinct mission. For example, the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) is a comprehensive federal anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing statute requiring that certain financial institutions (e.g., banks, broker-dealers, futures commission merchants, money services businesses and casinos) implement \"know your customer\" (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) programs. Enforcement of the BSA is led by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which is the bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury responsible for combating money laundering. Under the BSA, financial institutions and money service businesses (MSBs) must register with FinCEN, prepare a written AML compliance program, and file BSA reports for suspicious activity and currency transactions. Other BSA requirements relate to record-keeping for certain transactions and obtaining customer ID information. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), SEC and FINRA as well as state agencies, depending on the type of transaction and institution involved, regulate the custody of digital assets. Custody is a particularly tricky issue as it relates to digital assets with the tension focused on ease of access (e.g., hot wallets and omnibus accounts) versus strength of security (e.g., cold wallets and multi-factor authentication protocols). Examples of custody legal issues include establishing an operation under appropriate legal framework, like a state-licensed trust company, achieving Qualified Custodian status under federal law, access issues and limitations on liability. At the state level, there are 50 attorneys general and various state agencies that enforce digital asset-related laws (or other general laws that may apply to digital assets) passed by state legislatures and applied by the courts. Individual states are taking different approaches, and the laboratory of ideas is actively at work. For example, the New York State Department of Financial Services has enacted the Virtual Currency Business Activity regulatory framework (e.g., the \"BitLicense\" framework), which covers substantially all virtual currency activity by New York firms and residents. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Wyoming has passed legislation exempting virtual currency transactions from its money transmitter regulations, utility tokens from certain state securities registration and money transmitter laws and virtual currencies from property taxation laws. And Colorado recently issued guidance exempting certain types of digital asset exchanges from the state's money transmitter licensing requirements. It remains unsettled whether federal regulation will supersede state regulation in respect of digital assets and FinTech more generally, as the courts have not yet ruled on many aspects of crypto regulation. Increasingly, cryptocurrency and digital assets are looking less and less like a trend that will fall out of fashion and more like an important part of the future of finance. China is aggressively pushing its new Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the digital Yuan, and the UK and US are actively exploring their own CBDC initiatives. In the private sector, PayPal will soon allow customers to pay using cryptocurrency at more than 29 million online stores, and many major banks are rolling out crypto wallets and offering digital asset options to their customers. Whether as a store of value, medium of exchange, or digital representation of a physical asset, the possibilities presented by digital assets for reimagining the financial system, who has access and how they participate, is wide open. In the next column, we will look at some use cases for digital assets, what FinTech start-ups have been focused on, and what this means for financial institutions and other incumbents in the space.

While hospitals have been using UV-C lights for decades to disinfect operating rooms, the technology was not widely adopted because the machinery was expensive, said Ben Boyer, a co-founder of R-Zero. R-Zero, formed in April last year, makes its UV-C light banks on wheels in San Jose. The company said it has booked $15 million in sales to schools, restaurants, senior care facilities, sports arenas and jails, through a subscription model that starts at $17 a day. It plans to unveil a suite of sensors and a small, safe UV-C light machine that turns on automatically when people are in the room, an improvement over its current UV-C light product that turns off when someone enters the room. The company uses software to collect the data and automate the whole process, said Boyer.

But the policy comes at a substantial cost, estimated by the ruling centre-right coalition at 19.2 billion Norwegian crowns ($2.32 billion) in lost state revenue last year, or some 250,000 crowns on average for each new electric car sold. The more expensive a car is, the bigger the sales tax and other levies foregone by the state, thus giving the biggest implied subsidies to high-income households while also raising the cost per tonne of carbon emissions saved, the paper found. \"Norway could improve the targeting of its tax incentives to increase their environmental impact,\" the paper by three IMF economists concluded. One such targeted change could be to offer subsidies to actually scrap petrol and diesel cars when replaced by EVs, the economists said, adding that Norway should also consider raising the taxes imposed on polluting cars. The proposals could resonate well with Norway's centre-left opposition, which is favoured to win power in national elections due in September. While supporting the goal of selling only EVs by 2025, Norway's Labour and other centre-left parties all want to start imposing sales taxes on the portion of a car's cost that exceeds 600,000 crowns.

The dollar index  stood at 90.528, having hit a one-month high of 90.677 on Tuesday despite mixed U.S. economic data. With spending rotating back to services from goods as vaccinations allow Americans to travel and engage in other activities, the data cemented the perception of a strong recovery in the economy. Separate data showed wholesale price inflation accelerated to 6.6%, the largest gain since November 2010. Yet most investors think the Fed will refrain from any hints of starting tapering its stimulus in the near future. \"The Fed has said they're going to be reactionary to the data, ....and they\u2019ve said they want to see extended inflationary conditions before they make any commitment to tapering or hikes,\" said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo branch manager at State Street Bank. Wakabayashi said the dollar should rally if the Fed drops any hint that tapering will be brought forward or rate hikes are going to be looked at sooner, but added, \"I think they\u2019ll stick to the same tagline, and it will probably end up being a non-event.\" Some market players also noted the dollar could rise by default as other major currencies appear to be losing momentum. \"We have to note that the U.S. dollar is strengthening now even as U.S. debt yield has dropped below 1.5%,\" said Makoto Noji, chief FX strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities. \"Today's currency market suggests there is strong potential pressure to lift the dollar, should there be some sort of surprises from the Fed.\" The euro stood at $1.2126 , little changed on the day but struggling to recover from its fall last week after the European Central Bank pledged to keep stimulus steady over the summer.

Around 60% of an underground mine's energy consumption is for infrastructure, which is mainly electrified, but loaders and trucks, carrying up to 65 tonnes of rock, still run on diesel. Ager said electric machines should be fully proven to work in mines and be discussed in all procurement in 2-3 years. Investment bank UBS said electrification will bring lower emissions and savings for mining companies. \"In the years to come we shall see an accelerated replacement cycle for especially underground mining equipment, although surface equipment will also benefit from solid growth rates,\" analyst Guillermo Peigneux Lojo said. Battery-driven machines are more expensive to buy, but savings on ventilation and cooling, big costs in underground mines, makes it beneficial to go electric already, Ager said. It could take time, however, before fully electrified mines. \"Let's say we start selling more electric than diesel in 10 years ... before most diesel has been swapped for electricity, it's been more like 15-20 years,\" Ager said, adding Canada has moved farthest due to tough diesel rules. The Swedish firm, whose equipment uses lithium-ion rechargeable batteries, expects to offer a full range of underground electric loaders and haul trucks by 2022.

The U.S. currency has been buoyed as traders closed short positions before the Fed's two-day policy-setting confab, which kicks off on Tuesday. The dollar index , which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was flat early in Asia at 90.517. It has pushed briefly above 90.60 in each of the last two sessions, and 90.63 would be the strongest level since May 14. Traders will be watching carefully for clues on when policymakers will start tapering dollar-depreciating stimulus. So far Fed officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, have stressed that rising inflationary pressures are transitory and ultra-easy monetary settings will stay in place for some time to come, although recent economic data has raised concerns that price pressure after the post-COVID-19 economic reopening could force an earlier stimulus withdrawal. \"While Powell will tread carefully, I expect that the Fed is warming to a more open discussion about tapering, to be formally announced in the September meeting,\" Chris Weston, head of research at broker Pepperstone in Melbourne, wrote in a note to clients. \"Any view that cements a formal announcement in September should be modestly USD bullish, but the risks are symmetrical as Powell will be keen to not hurt financial conditions,\" he wrote.

It's an unexpected priority. Nickel isn't on the U.S. list of critical minerals. Although the country depends on imports, 68% of supplies come from what the report calls \"allied nations\" such as Canada, Australia, Norway and Finland. But the Department of Energy (DOE) has identified Class 1 nickel, the type best suited to lithium-ion batteries, as both key vulnerability and key opportunity. The emphasis on nickel doesn't mean the White House is complacent about other critical battery materials such as lithium and cobalt but it says a lot about how the administration is thinking about the problem. LOW RESERVES, NO PROCESSING The United States is import-dependent across the spectrum of battery metals with large parts of the supply chain captured by China, a problematic international trading partner. However, the nature of the dependency differs by mineral, starting in the ground. The United States, for example, \"has lithium resources and domestic corporations well-versed in recovery and refinement globally\", according to the report. The ambition, therefore, is to stimulate more domestic mining and, even more importantly, domestic processing through a potential mix of purchasing guarantees, federal funding and research and development into enhanced recovery technology. China's investment in this section of the supply chain \"has made them the world's leader despite limited domestic lithium supply\", the report notes. When it comes to nickel, however, the only active U.S. mine - Eagle in Michigan - is due to retire in 2025 and domestic deposits are small and low grade. There is no domestic nickel processing capacity outside a limited amount of by-product salt production. Yet this particular battery metal is the one likely to experience the most significant demand increase over the coming years, the report says, with \"market indications that there could be a large shortage of Class 1 nickel in the next 3-7 years\". Indeed, with nickel content rising in battery cathode design, not having enough of the right kind of nickel \"poses a supply chain risk for battery manufacturing globally, not just in the United States\". RE-DESIGNING DEMAND Nickel demand is rising because automakers are trying to reduce their usage of cobalt, a metal that is overshadowed by a supply-chain reliance on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and its artisanal workforce. The Department of Energy wants to help them with a commitment to \"a multi-year initiative to address the scientific and engineering issues with reducing and eliminating the cobalt in EV batteries\". Research is already taking place into new materials such as  silicon and lithium metal anodes with progress to date \"very good\", the report says. The DOE awarded cobalt the \"lowest 'quality' supply chain score of all elements, largely due to the alleged mining conditions in the Democratic Republic of Congo and conditions surrounding cobalt refining in China\". But with most of the world's known cobalt reserves in the Congo, there's an acceptance that short-term risks can only be partly mitigated through a combination of maximising domestic resources, particularly old tailings, and working with allied countries. The report recommends using the U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to \"identify projects in allied and partner nations that can be funded to create new sustainable mining and processing operations for lithium, graphite, and other key metals and materials\". RECYCLING Also critical to reducing critical minerals dependence will be building recycling capacity, according to the DOE. Battery recycling could meet up to 30% of nickel and 80% of cobalt usage in electric vehicles by the end of the decade but there are multiple hurdles in getting there. It will require a national recycling policy to align a sector that is currently fragmented by state legislation. Without one batteries will go to landfill or be exported to other countries where the metals will be extracted. It will also need more research and development on how to recycle electric vehicle batteries because it's currently unprofitable in many cases and is becoming more chemically difficult as battery ingredients multiply. Ideally, it should take place in tandem with a build-out of other parts of the battery supply chain such as cell and pack manufacture, allowing \"new\" scrap to be continuously looped back into the production process. The report recommends the United States should form a cross-agency task force to \"capture a holistic view of the opportunity landscape and to coordinate action to support domestic recycling\". Despite the long list of challenges, the DOE concludes that recycled material can \"buffer volume and price instabilities\" in the short term and, as ever more EV batteries reach end-of-life, \"could eventually supply a significant share of critical battery material needs\". NICKEL URGENCY Recycling will likely help close the U.S. dependency gap faster in cobalt than it will in nickel. This is because the current recyclables stream is largely made up of consumer electronics and first-generation EVs, neither of which contain much nickel. The world is going to need a lot more new nickel before recycling can make a real impact. There is a nickel mining and processing boom underway in Indonesia but rather than offering any comfort to the United States, the dominance of Chinese players simply means the country risks \"falling further behind China in this critical mineral\". As such, \"there is urgency to developing a strategy around Class 1 nickel\", the report concludes. Starting with a U.S.-funded nickel processing plant.

Stellantis opened the doors of its new $1.6 billion Mack Avenue assembly complex on Thursday, showing off parts of a 3 million square foot complex completed and launched into production largely during the pandemic. The Grand Cherokee L vehicles on the assembly line are the first of a new generation of Jeep's best-selling model line, aimed at expanding the brand's sales to customers who want an SUV with three rows of seats. The plant, which began building vehicles in March, now is operating three shifts a day, plant manager Michael Brieda said. In a tight labor market, Brieda said the biggest challenge the plant had \"was finding people capable of working in a manufacturing environment.\" Job applicants were given dexterity tests as part of their interviews, he said. About 2,100 Detroit City residents have been hired at the plant, the company said. The new Jeep plant underscores the split personality of the United States vehicle market, where most of the vehicles coming down the Mack assembly line will be sold. But for Detroit's automakers, demand for pickup trucks and decked-out gasoline-fueled SUVs still pays the bills. As the Mack assembly complex accelerates, Stellantis will have two adjacent factories in Detroit capable of building 500,000 or more Grand Cherokee models a year. The nearby Jefferson North Jeep plant was built in 1991 - and until now was the Motor City's newest assembly plant. Mario Holmes, the manager who oversaw the development of the Grand Cherokee L, said much effort went into designing a new, more efficient architecture that uses aluminum and high-strength steel to cut weight. Though the new model has three rows of seats, it's in the same weight class as five-passenger SUVs, he said. There will be an electrified powertrain offered, but details on that will come later, he said. One sign of the importance of the Grand Cherokee L is that Brieda, the plant manager, said he has had no problems getting enough semiconductors for the new model, even as Stellantis is idling assembly lines for other vehicles amid a global shortage of the chips needed for modern motoring systems.

U.S. proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis on Friday urged shareholders at this year's AGM to vote against the re-appointment of Toshiba board chairman Osamu Nagayama and four others nominated to the board by the company. As one of the industrial conglomerates that modernized Japan and helped its post-World War Two economic recovery, Toshiba enjoys close ties with the government. Its nuclear reactors and defence equipment businesses mean it is also closely monitored by industry bureaucrats. In 2017, however, battered by accounting scandals and massive writedowns on its U.S. nuclear reactor business, Toshiba had to quickly seek a large capital injection from overseas investors. As a result, activist investors are estimated to account for 25% of Toshiba's shareholder base. Since the push by activist shareholders this year for greater accountability, Toshiba has faced a $20 billion bid from CVC Capital and seen former CEO Nobuaki Kurumatani resign in the ensuing turmoil.

The company's design leader, Franz\u00a0von Holzhausen, served as master of ceremonies and carried a sledgehammer on stage to introduce CEO Elon Musk \u2014 a humorous allusion to a previous event where von Holzhausen smashed and shattered a Cybertruck's windows on stage. Musk made his entrance on Thursday by driving a Model S Plaid around the Tesla test track and onto the stage before stepping out to cheers of select customers and fans invited to the event. Previously, Musk had promised the long-anticipated Tesla Model S Plaid would deliver acceleration from 0 to 60 mph in under 2 seconds, and he crowed about \"breaking the 2-second barrier,\" repeatedly on Thursday. Musk said the new Model S would be, \"Faster than Porsche but safer than Volvo.\"\u00a0But he also caveated some of his own sweeping safety claims by noting that NHTSA has not yet rated the Model S Plaid for safety.\u00a0 \"We're in production and gonna deliver the first 25 cars now, and then basically should be at several hundred cars per week soon and a thousand cars per week next quarter,\" Musk said. According to Tesla's website, the tri-motor, all-wheel drive Model S Plaid produces 1,020 horsepower, features a battery with an estimated EPA-rated range of up to 390 miles and can hit a top speed of 200 miles per hour, if equipped with the proper wheels and tires. Those won't be available until the fall, according to the fine print on the site. On Thursday, Musk offered no significant details on the Model S Plaid battery pack, saying simply, \"We have an all-new battery pack.\" (Tesla is struggling to manufacture a 4680 battery cell that it designed and intends to use in its own vehicles someday.) Musk quickly moved on from a brief mention of the battery to show images of the Model S Plaid drive unit, and boasted about a \"carbon-wrapped\" rotor that is part of the vehicle's electric motor. \"You can pick this motor up with your hands and it can accelerate a two-ton car to 60 miles an hour in 2 seconds. That kind of power-to-weight is insane,\" he said. He noted that the Model S Plaid can get 187 miles of range in just 15 minutes plugged into a Tesla Supercharger. Attendees would have a chance to drive around the track, he said. Musk also touted myriad changes to the Model S Plaid interior, most of which were previously disclosed. The four-door sedan includes a steering yoke rather than a traditional steering wheel, a 17-inch center touchscreen display and separate 8-inch display in the rear for passengers' entertainment, charging ports in the front and rear that can charge laptops and other mobile devices, and processing power that the company says puts its systems on par with modern gaming consoles like the PlayStation 5. When Musk began to discuss the user interface updates to be featured in the Model S Plaid, attendees began to heckle him, shouting for \"Waypoints,\" a feature they've long wanted the company to deliver. With waypoints, drivers could enter several destinations into one trip within Tesla's navigation system. \"You really want waypoints,\" the CEO said acquiescing. \"Alright, fine we'll do waypoints. Goddamnit. Alright,\" Musk laughed. He also said that Model S Plaid with Autopilot engaged could guess what direction, location and route a driver would want to take. \"It will just keep minimizing the amount of input that you need to do until the car just reads your mind,\" Musk said. He did not specify which versions of Tesla's software would be required in a Model S Plaid software to enable that level of automation. Tesla's standard Autopilot and premium Full Self Driving options do not make the company's cars self-driving.

Then, Tesla reported that Model S (and Model X) production dropped to zero in its first-quarter vehicle deliveries and production update. Before Thursday's heavily promoted delivery event, originally slated for June 3, Musk said on Twitter that Tesla also canceled the Model S Plaid plus variant which would have cost drivers around $150,000 and promised a tantalizing battery range of around 520 miles. Musk said, in a pair of tweets hyping Model S Plaid before the deliveries kickoff: \"Plaid+ is canceled. No need, as Plaid is just so good,\" adding \"0 to 60mph in under 2 secs. Quickest production car ever made of any kind. Has to be felt to be believed.\" On Thursday, the price of the Model S Plaid had increased by $10,000 to $129,990 \u2014 which compares with $79,990 for a long-range 2021 Model S, a dual-motor, all wheel drive version of the electric sedan boasting a battery range of 405 miles (according to the Tesla website, which previously listed it at 412 miles). The Plaid moniker for Tesla's high performance version of the Model S is a continuation of the company's tribute to \"Spaceballs\" \u2014 the 1980s Star Wars spoof co-written, produced and directed by Mel Brooks. In \"Spaceballs,\" spacecraft accelerate from light- to ridiculous- then ludicrous-speed and finally into \"plaid.\" Earlier versions of Tesla vehicles featured Ludicrous mode, which Tesla first announced in July of 2015.

Everybody asks me\u00a0what should I do with my\u00a0bitcoin?\u00a0The only thing I know for\u00a0certain, I want 5% in gold, 5%\u00a0in\u00a0bitcoin, 5% in cash, 5% in\u00a0commodities,\" Tudor Jones said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Monday. The cryptocurrency began its latest surge on Sunday after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the electric vehicle maker could accept bitcoin transactions again in the future. After starting Sunday trading at just $34,880,\u00a0bitcoin\u00a0jumped above $40,000 early Monday. The cryptocurrency was off the highs of the day as of the latest trading, but still up 5.4% in 24 hours to $39,749, according to Coinbase. Since the start of the year, bitcoin has surged more than 30%, though it has experienced wild swings. It hit an all-time high of $64,829.14 in April and hit a low near $30,000 in May following a 30% intraday crash. With the expected rise in inflation this past year, institutional investors' interest in bitcoin as a store of value has grown significantly and fueled its most recent bull run. Tudor Jones first revealed last spring on CNBC that he held \"almost 2%\" of his assets in bitcoin. Since then Stanley Druckenmiller, Bill Miller and Ray Dalio have also become more outspoken bitcoin enthusiasts. Institutions rode that momentum, with major custody banks like BNY Mellon and State Street seeking to offer crypto services for clients and major financial institutions like BlackRock, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs figuring out how to safely offer clients exposure to bitcoin. Previously, there was tremendous career risk for investment institutions trying to get bitcoin into their portfolios. \"For me, it's just a way of kind\u00a0of foundationally looking at how\u00a0do I protect my wealth over\u00a0time, it's a great diversifier,\" Tudor Jones added. \"Again, I look at\u00a0bitcoin\u00a0as a\u00a0story of wealth. I look at crypto as a story of\u00a0wealth. Others will argue this is a\u00a0different ecosystem, it's transactional in nature.\" Bitcoin went up about another $700 shortly after the investor's comments. The weekend gains came after Musk said Sunday that Tesla will resume allowing bitcoin transactions \"when there's confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend.\" Tesla halted car purchases with bitcoin in mid-May, citing concerns over the climate impact of cryptocurrency mining. Tudor Jones also said Monday that he's concerned about bitcoin's environmental impact and \"If I was king of the world I'd ban bitcoin mining.\" Crypto mining requires massive amounts of energy to fuel powerful computers \u2014 bitcoin mining consumes more energy than entire countries such as Finland and Belgium, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. The latest development marks yet another example of large market moves following comments by the Tesla CEO and billionaire. Hundreds of billions of dollars were wiped off the cryptocurrency market after Musk tweeted in May about Tesla's suspension of car purchases using bitcoin. Musk's past tweets have also been linked to moves in the stock market \u2014 ranging from so-called meme stocks such as\u00a0GameStop, to the investor of viral song \"Baby Shark.\" The environmental impact of bitcoin mining has come under intense scrutiny. As part of its crackdown on bitcoin, China's Inner Mongolia region \u2014 a major bitcoin mining hub \u2014 in late-May proposed punishments for companies and individuals involved in digital currency mining. It came after Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said it is necessary to \"crack down on Bitcoin mining and trading behavior\" to prevent the \"transmission of individual risks to the social field.\" Elsewhere, Iran's government in announced in May a ban on the mining of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies until Sept. 22, after officials said blackouts in the country's capital of Tehran and several other large cities were in part due to the energy-intensive activity. \u2014 CNBC's Arjun Kharpal and Natasha Turak contributed to this report.

Draper first made the bold price prediction back in 2018, at which time bitcoin was trading around $8,000, according to Coinbase. \"I'm either going to be really right or really wrong [but] I'm pretty sure that it's going in that direction,\" Draper says. That's because Draper believes the currency is going to be \"much more in use by then.\" \"Give it about a year and a half and retailers will all be on Opennode [a bitcoin payment processor], so everybody will accept bitcoin,\" Draper predicts. Currently only a few major companies accept bitcoin directly or indirectly through a third-party digital wallet app, including Microsoft, PayPal, Overstock, Whole Foods, Starbucks and Home Depot. And many experts see bitcoin as a store of value, like gold, rather than a currency. \"Then beyond that, I think [bitcoin] continues up because there are only 21 million of them,\" says Draper. By virtue of its code, only 21 million bitcoin can be \"mined.\" So far, more than 18 million bitcoin are already in circulation. Draper, 63, who built his fortune by making early investments in Twitter, Skype,\u00a0Tesla\u00a0and SpaceX (to name a few),\u00a0wouldn't share how much bitcoin he holds or whether he has invested in other cryptocurrencies. \"There must be something to dogecoin because it makes us all smile but no engineers are working on it,\" Drapers says. (Though, Elon Musk tweeted in May he was working with \"Doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency. Potentially promising.\") \"I tend to focus on the ones where people are dedicating their lives to improving the currency,\" Draper adds. Draper says most engineers are working on improving bitcoin right now. Last week, bitcoin got its first upgrade in four years, called Taproot. Due to take effect in November, the change will reportedly mean greater transaction privacy and efficiency. It is also meant to unlock the potential for smart contracts on the bitcoin blockchain, CNBC reported. Bitcoin \"is sort of like Microsoft [in] the software world or Amazon in the e-commerce world,\" Draper says. He believes bitcoin will be the center of all financial activity for the next two to three decades. However, bitcoin's value is volatile, and there are concerns over its enormous energy usage. For this and other reasons, experts recommend only investing as much money in bitcoin as you can afford to lose. Hundreds of billions of dollars were wiped off of the cryptocurrency after Elon Musk tweeted in May that he was suspending bitcoin purchases at Tesla over environmental concerns. \"Elon, first of all, is one of the most brilliant men in the world...maybe the most brilliant, [but] he got this one wrong,\" Draper said last week. (A Tesla spokesperson did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It's request for comment.) Draper points out that big banks have their own environmental issues. On Sunday, Musk tweeted that Tesla would accept bitcoin again when at least half of it can be mined using clean energy. Bitcoin rose more than 7%, nearing $40,000 on Monday, according to Coinbase. In April, it hit an all-time high of $64,829 before hitting a low of $30,000 in May following a 30% intraday crash, according to CNBC. It's not the first time, Draper has predicted the rise of the price of bitcoin. In 2014, when bitcoin was trading at around $500, he said bitcoin would top $10,000 within three years. In December 2017, bitcoin reached over $10,000, ballooning to a high of more than $18,900 that Dec. 19 before sliding back down to a low of $7,270 in early 2018, according to Coindesk. In 2014, Draper purchased nearly 30,000 bitcoins seized by the U.S. Marshals Services from the now-defunct online black market Silk Road.

Beyond EV pioneer and market leader Tesla, virtually every major auto manufacturer is lining up to flip the e-switch and it is not just a big deal for consumers, but the thousands of auto dealerships across the country that will need to embrace the electric future. General Motors has said it's aiming to produce only EVs by 2035, with 30 new plug-in models arriving by 2025, marking a $27-billion investment. Ford, which previously committed $22 billion to EV development, just announced that 40% of its vehicles will be electrified by 2030. Toyota, Volkswagen, Daimler, Hyundai, Fiat Chrysler, Honda and other automakers are making similar pledges. In preparation for this onslaught of new models, franchise car dealers in the U.S. \u2014 many of them longtime small businesses located in suburban and rural communities \u2014 are gearing up. Salespeople are getting ready to put you in an EV today. And because EVs have fewer moving parts, service technicians are being trained to maintain them. \"EVs are the big issue right now,\" said Mark Paladino, general manager of Colonial Ford in Danbury, Connecticut, and a 40-year veteran in the business. He was still excited about Ford's debut of the F-150 Lightning pickup, an all-electric version of the best-selling vehicle line in the nation for four decades running. Paladino's excitement is warranted, considering that Ford.com tallied 70,000 reservations for the Lightning within the first week of its official release on May 19, with $100 deposits plunked down for each, said Jason Mase, Ford's cross vehicle marketing manager. That followed the successful introduction of Ford's Mustang Mach-E electric vehicle, where 70% of initial customers were new to Ford. For the F-150 Lightning, Mase said, \"90% ordered the highest trim level and 80% ordered the extended-range battery. ... It was beyond our expectations.\" Colonial is one of 2,300 Ford dealers, among a total of roughly 3,000, that have volunteered to become EV-certified, an investment that entails training sales and service personnel, upgrading battery-charging stations and purchasing special equipment, parts and tools. The remaining third have thus far opted out of spending nearly $50,000 for the certification. Other manufacturers are asking for upwards of $300,000 for the designation.\u00a0 \"We were all in right away,\" Paladino said, adding that the family-owned dealership was previously trained on several gas-electric hybrid models, as well as Ford's first-ever EV, the 2021 Mustang Mach-E SUV, introduced in December. \"We see EVs as a part of our business that will only get larger, and we want to be in that world.\" EVs comprise less than 3% of overall new-car sales in the U.S. \u00a0Tesla has dominated the market, making up about about 55% of it, according to Credit Suisse \u2014 though that's down from 72% a few months ago, reflecting the growth in competition. Although EVs now represent only a fraction of the U.S. automotive fleet, they \"are eventually going to become a significant part of a car retailer's business,\" said Chris Sutton, vice president of automotive retail for market research firm J.D. Power. EV stocks are 'overpriced' \u2014 but there's a good way to play them, says strategist BofA picks 3 auto stocks to buy as 'car wars' heat up Citi upgrades Nio, says growing EV demand in China can lift stock more than 50% EV stocks are 'overpriced' \u2014 but there's a good way to play them, says strategist BofA picks 3 auto stocks to buy as 'car wars' heat up Citi upgrades Nio, says growing EV demand in China can lift stock more than 50% A Bloomberg New Energy Finance report estimated that by 2040, EVs will account for 58% of worldwide passenger vehicle sales, with China, Europe and the U.S., respectively, leading the pack.\u00a0 \"By providing their sales and service expertise, and as an education resource for customers, they add value to automakers,\" Sutton said of dealerships. Though he added that because EV sales to date have been concentrated in coastal states, Michigan and Texas, many dealers elsewhere remain in wait-and-see mode. In addition to manufacturers' ambitious targets, the Biden administration has proposed spending nearly $42 billion to build out the nation's EV battery-charging infrastructure, gas prices have inched up and ExxonMobil's shareholders elected three climate-friendly directors supported by an activist investing group to its board. Support for Biden's infrastructure spending plan, however, to which EV infrastructure spending is tied, remains uncertain. Car dealers are focused on the here and now. They should be heartened, then, by a Cars.com survey that reveals two-thirds of Americans are interested in buying an EV, despite barriers such as higher sticker prices than internal combustion engine (ICE) models and the paucity of charging stations. Plus, some EVs still qualify for a $7,500 federal tax credit, while states such as California, New Jersey and New York offer additional rebates up to $5,000. These data help explain why the 17,000 members of the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) \"can't wait for EV products to get here,\" said NADA President and CEO Mike Stanton. \"Dealers are in the business of selling cars and making customers happy, so why wouldn't they want to sell EVs?\" he said, dismissing reports of lackluster enthusiasm among dealers. Political support for climate change policies vary across the nation, and in the past year support has been dropping among Republicans for the federal government making action on clean energy a top priority, according to a recent survey conducted by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason Center for Climate Change Communication. But considerable support remains among conservatives for providing tax rebates to people who purchase energy-efficient vehicles or solar panels: 78% of moderate Republicans and 60% of conservative Republicans. It was the only \"climate-friendly energy policy\" in the survey which a majority of both moderate Republican and conservative Republican registered voters support. One genuine concern for dealers, however, is the fact that EVs don't require oil changes, transmission repairs and other service owners of ICE vehicles routinely bear \u2014 and that account for 50% of dealers' gross profits. A 2019 report from AlixPartners estimates that dealers could see $1,300 less revenue in service and parts over the life of each EV they sell. Even though 70% of aftermarket service of ICE vehicles is handled by independent shops, franchise dealers don't want to cede EVs to them, especially as consumers familiarize themselves with battery charging and other peculiarities. \"The EV owner might trust the dealers more to perform service than the aftermarket shops earlier in their ownership period,\" Sutton said. The service element doesn't necessarily worry Rita Case, CEO of Rick Case Automotive Group in Ft. Lauderdale, which represents VW, Hyundai, Honda, Audi, Mazda and other brands at its dealerships in south Florida and Atlanta. \"EVs need tires, brakes, batteries, lights and some steering and drivetrain maintenance,\" she stated. Rick Case Auto is already selling and servicing a limited number of EVs and hybrids, but \"within the last six months we've ramped up EV training for our salespeople and technicians and purchased new charging equipment\" in anticipation of increased consumer demand for new electric models, Case said. GM has been readying its 4,100 franchise dealers over the past year, not only for the refreshed Chevrolet Bolt \u2014 an early EV entrant that has gone through a recent design \u2014 but also the upcoming electric GMC Hummer and the Cadillac Lyriq. \"Service is critical to what our dealers do today and will be in the future,\" said Travis Hester, GM's chief electric vehicle officer. \"EV service will definitely evolve and won't be exactly the same\" compared to that for ICE vehicles, he said, noting that some EV parts may last 10 to 15 years. \"No one is panicking about it, but we know it's going to change over time, so we're working with our dealers on that.\" Meanwhile, Paladino can't keep up with Colonial Ford's conventional service demands. \"We're booking and servicing every vehicle we can,\" he said. \"Right now, I'm three weeks out in servicing your car.\" Another issue on dealers' minds is direct-to-consumer (D2C) sales, the business model that's fueled Tesla's marketing of more than 385,000 EVs on U.S. roads to date. Tesla does operate about 130 company-owned showrooms, yet sales are transacted online. At last count, 33 states allowed D2C auto sales, with others' legislatures debating bills that would bypass the so-called franchise system that has legally connected dealers and manufacturers for more than a century. NADA, states' dealer groups and traditional automakers have advocated maintaining the franchise system, claiming that it levels the playing field. Then again, online marketing is nothing new to car manufacturers and dealers. Every brand maintains a website where shoppers can peruse models and pricing, and even custom design a new car. But they're ultimately referred to a local dealer, who completes the transaction and aims to establish a loyal relationship that includes routine maintenance, service and perhaps a future sale. Generating foot traffic \u2014 the proverbial \"kicking the tires\" routine \u2014 is the lifeblood of dealers' business models, so to survive they will have to adjust to consumers' appetite for buying directly online, a routine that only expanded during the pandemic. That means letting manufacturers take reservations and deposits online, as Ford and other manufacturers are doing, and finding ways to attract and foster long-term relationships with a new generation of EV drivers, such as special test-drive events, on-site charging and mobile service techs who make house calls. \"The dealer network has been around for a long time because they are able to pivot to where the market is and what customers expect and require,\" Sutton said. The auto industry is at an inflection point in the transition to EVs, and dealers large and small will have to pivot once again. \"If you're going to play in the EV sector, you've got embrace it now \u2014 the charging infrastructure, the parts, the equipment, the labor,\" Paladino said. While Case is waiting for greater demand for EVs, she's \"super positive\" about the future. \"I'm in the business of selling cars, and one thing I know for sure is people are going to want cars.\" "}, {"source": "CNBC", "title": "China's electric car leaders predict new energy vehicles will dominate the local market by 2030 ", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/15/chinas-top-ev-car-makers-predict-new-energy-vehicles-will-dominate.html", "date": "Tue, 15 Jun 2021 07:38:40 GMT", "content": "BEIJING \u2014 New energy vehicles will dominate the world's largest auto market in about ten years, two executives from major Chinese electric car companies predicted over the weekend.

He forecast that the penetration rate would surge to more than 70% in 2030. That's according to a transcript the company provided of his remarks at the China Auto Chongqing Summit held June 12 and 13. William Li, founder and CEO of electric car start-up Nio, was more optimistic. He predicted that so-called smart electric cars would account for 90% of new car sales in 2030, according to Chinese media reports. Nio did not have anything to add when contacted by CNBC. The U.S.-listed automaker leads its start-up peers in terms of monthly deliveries. But Nio's deliveries of 6,711 cars in May fell from 7,102 in April, remaining well below that of BYD. In May, BYD said its new energy passenger car sales rose 23% from the prior month to 31,681 vehicles, of which just over half \u2014 or 18,711 \u2014 were powered only by batteries. The company's Han sedan ranks among the five best-selling new energy vehicles sold in China \u2014 just behind Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y for the first five months of the year, according to the China Passenger Car Association. In first place is a budget electric car, the Wuling Hongguang Mini, developed under a General Motors' joint venture in China. Many foreign automakers such as Volkswagen have looked to launch electric cars in China first, where sales of battery-powered vehicles have gotten a boost from central government subsidies and other preferential policies. Beijing would like 20% of new cars sold to be new energy vehicles by 2025. As the local new energy vehicle market grows, BYD's Wang said he expects Chinese car brands will be able to account for 60% by 2030, thanks partly to their grasp of core technology.

It also said it is raising its earnings guidance for the first half of the year. The additional money will be used to\u00a0expand its rollout of EVs and accelerate production of its battery and fuel cell technologies, including two new U.S. battery plants in addition to two under construction, by 2025. America's largest automaker is racing to catch up to EV leader Tesla and compete for a leadership position against other well-established automakers such as Volkswagen. GM plans to sell more than 1 million EVs annually by 2025. \"There are several growth engines in General Motors, and we're going to just keep pushing ahead and accelerating them like we're doing today of announcing a faster pivot to EVs,\" CEO Mary Barra said Wednesday on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"I really see long-term value creation for General Motors and for our shareholders.\" GM's plans to expand its electric and autonomous vehicle lineup and technology have been praised by Wall Street. Its stock has almost tripled since reaching a 12-month low of $23.33 last July. Shares were up by as much as 4% during trading early Wednesday morning to about $63 a share. GM said the new investments are enabled by its strong underlying business, including record pretax earnings over the last three quarters and strong demand for its upcoming EVs. \"Across the board, we are seeing exceptionally strong reactions and positive response to all of our electric vehicles,\" Barra said. CFO Paul Jacobson said GM projects better-than-expected results in the second quarter despite a global semiconductor chip shortage that's impacting the industry. He said GM expects adjusted pretax earnings of $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion during the first half of the year, up from an estimated $5.5 billion. For the year, GM previously said it expected pretax profits \"at the higher end\" of a $10 billion to $11 billion range.\u00a0It didn't provide an update on its full-year earnings. \"We remain cautious about the full year, and we'll have more information about the full-year guidance on our earnings call on Aug. 4,\" Jacobson told reporters during a call Wednesday. GM's increased spending plans come less than a month after crosstown rival Ford Motor increased its EV spending to more than $30 billion by 2025. But Ford's investments date to 2016, while GM's are for 2020 through 2025. Before the coronavirus pandemic shut down auto factories in March 2020, GM initially said it would invest $20 billion in autonomous and electric vehicles through 2025. It increased that spending to $27 billion in November as it pulled ahead vehicle programs and accelerated battery cell production. GM's previously said it would roll out 30 new EVs by 2025. The company said Wednesday it will add to those plans, but it declined to provide more details. \"We feel good about all of our projects that are going on,\" Jacobson said. \"We're moving aggressively and there's a lot a lot of exciting things ahead for us.\" GM's new investments were announced ahead of Barra's meeting Wednesday with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats to discuss EVs and vehicle emissions, according to Reuters, which first reported on the automaker's plans late Tuesday. A GM spokesman confirmed Barra is in Washington but declined to comment on specific meetings. Barra told CNBC the company is continuing to have discussions about incentives and other regulatory matters regarding EVs. Buyers of EVs from GM as well as Tesla are no longer eligible for an up to $7,500 federal tax credit after the companies sold 200,000 of the vehicles. GM has been lobbying to have such incentives reinstated. \"We really think being a first mover shouldn't be something that's penalized as we look at EV adoption,\" Barra said. \"We continue to have those discussions.

Billionaire hedge fund manager\u00a0Paul Tudor Jones\u00a0said this week's Fed meeting could be the most important in Powell's career, and he warned that the chairman could spark a big sell-off in risk assets if he doesn't do a good job of signaling a taper. \"If they course correct, if they say, 'We've got incoming data, we've accomplished our mission or we're on the way very rapidly to accomplishing our mission on employment,' then you're going to get a taper tantrum,\" Tudor Jones said. \"You're going to get a sell-off in fixed income.

Ford announced last month it would accelerate the rollout of EVs under a new restructuring plan, called \"Ford+,\" led by CEO Jim Farley. The plan aims to bring in 40% of Ford's global sales volume via EVs by 2030.\u00a0 \"Lincoln will usher in a new era of electrified vehicles and connected experiences globally, and we plan to deliver a full portfolio of electrified Lincoln vehicles globally by the end of the decade,\" Lincoln President Joy Falotico said during a media briefing. Lincoln's EV targets fall short of its largest American rival, Cadillac. The General Motors luxury brand has plans to offer only EVs by 2030. Neither Lincoln nor Cadillac offer a fully electric vehicle in their current lineups as they attempt to catch up to EV leader Tesla. Cadillac's plans are part of a larger \"aspiration\" by GM to\u00a0exclusively sell\u00a0EVs by 2035. Falotico said Lincoln will continue to offer plug-in hybrid electric vehicles as well as gas vehicles as the brand transitions to EVs. She declined to set a timeline for Lincoln to reach a 100% electric lineup, saying it will depend on customer demand, specifically in its largest markets of North America and China. \"We're going all-in to be a fully electric brand, but we'll do it as the customers adopt,\" she told CNBC. Lincoln said it will debut a new EV for China and North America next year as the brand celebrates its 100th anniversary. It will join the plug-in hybrid Aviator and Corsair SUVs. Lincoln said its plans to launch four new EVs, but it did not disclose a specific timeframe for those vehicles. Falotico also declined to specify whether Lincoln's new EVs will share names with their current four vehicles, including the well-known Navigator SUV.

In case you missed it, here are seven things worth knowing about what happened in crypto over the last week. The Justice Department reported on June 7 it successfully retrieved\u00a0$2.3 million in bitcoin\u00a0paid by Colonial Pipeline to ransomware hackers in April.\u00a0 The news caused a stir of confusion online \u2060\u2014 some speculated that bitcoin was \"hacked,\" and a day after the announcement, the price of bitcoin\u00a0seemed to slide\u00a0due to concerns over security of the cryptocurrency. Though it isn't exactly clear how it was done, experts say the FBI's ability to retrieve the bitcoin ransom was due to the criminals' storage of their private keys, rather than any vulnerability with the cryptocurrency itself. El Salvador passed a new law to adopt bitcoin as legal tender on Wednesday, becoming the first country to do so. This allows bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, to be used as payment for goods and taxes. Businesses can price their goods in bitcoin, and exchanges will not be subject to capital gains tax, CNBC reported. Following the news, bitcoin's price jumped 6% to over $37,000 on Thursday. During the Senate banking\u00a0committee hearing on central bank digital currencies on Wednesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called for cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S. \"Cryptocurrency has created opportunities to scam investors, assist criminals and worsen the climate crisis,\" she said. \"The threats posted by crypto show that Congress and federal regulators can't continue to hide out, hoping that crypto will go away. It won't.

In recent years, billionaires including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and businessman Michael Bloomberg, investors Carl Icahn and George Soros paid little to no federal income taxes, according to the report from ProPublica, which cited confidential IRS data it obtained. \"They obviously are able to avoid paying income tax. Not evade. But avoid. And I know avoid is legal and the government says you can do everything you can to avoid. I think that has to be changed,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said on \"Squawk Box,\" citing the wealth inequalities that divide the nation. \"There's not billions of billionaires. Let's come up with something for this small group,\" added Cramer, who spoke in generalities about a billionaire surtax. However, he did describe an approach that differed from Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax proposal. \"Does Elizabeth Warren talk about it in a way that I think is a little bit too severe. Yes,\" he said. Warren's plan, released earlier this year, is called the \"Ultra-Millionaire Tax.\" It would impose a 2% annual tax on household net worth between $50 million and $1 billion and a 3% annual tax on household net worth above $1 billion. Following this week's ProPublica report, Democratic Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Democratic Virginia Rep. Don Beyer reintroduced their \"Millionaires Surtax\" legislation, more akin to what Cramer put forward, except the bill would tax a much wider swath of rich Americans. The Van Hollen-Beyer bill \"would apply an additional 10-percentage point tax to incomes above $2 million for married couples or above $1 million for individuals,\" according to a summary of the measure, released Thursday. Cramer also talked about a billionaire surtax in a series of tweets Friday, saying \"these revelations make me sick,\" referring to the tax avoidance strategies employed by the uber-wealthy in the ProPublica report. The ProPublica article, expected to be the first in a series, did not reveal how the journalists obtained the tax records. The outlet did not respond to a request from CNBC for comment. CNBC has not independently verified the information in the report. Later on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street,\" Cramer said: \"We're not asking for Elizabeth Warren to take. We don't want to necessarily confiscate. But we have to find a way to say listen, 'We know you use avoidance and we don't know how to beat it. But we're going to put a surtax on it.'\" \"Maybe you think it's too blunt. But I've had it,\" he said, expressing concern about the ever-widening wealth gap in America. \"We can't let this go on any more in a democracy.\" Become a smarter investor with\u00a0CNBC Pro.\u00a0Get stock picks, analyst calls, exclusive interviews and access to CNBC TV.\u00a0Sign up to start a\u00a0free trial today.

It is known that America's super riches have various ways to dodge taxes. Warren Buffett has said many times before that billionaires like him pay too little tax. His income tax rate is even lower than that of his secretary. So how little do they actually pay? ProPublica, a nonprofitable media agency headquartered in New York City, obtained tax records of the wealthiest Americans in over 15 years, and they found that the income tax rates for the rich are much lower than those for the general public. In some years, some of the richest paid zero. According to this report, Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon and the world's richest man, paid zero federal income tax in 2007 and 2011. Tesla founder Elon Musk, who became the second richest man last year, paid nothing in 2018. Legendary investor George Soros paid no federal income tax three years in a row. In the five-year span from 2014 to 2018, the wealth of the 25 richest Americans grew by $401 billion according to Forbes; but they only paid a total of $13.6 billion in federal income taxes. That means the actual income tax rate for them was merely 3.4%, asserts ProPublica. Among these richest, Warren Buffet paid the least, with an actual rate of 0.01%, and that of Jeff Bezos is also below 1%, followed by Elon Musk with 3.27%. It's a different picture for middle-class households. From 2014 to 2018, wage earners in their early 40s saw their net worth expand by about $65,000 after taxes on average, whereas their tax bills as much nearly $62,000. In recent years, the median income of American households has been around $70,000, with a federal income tax rate of 14%.\u00a0 The big difference between the wealthiest and the middle-class in paying income taxes is because their incomes are generated in different ways. Most American families rely on wages as a major source of income, whereas the richest amass significant wealth largely from stocks and other investments. The rich can report little income for tax if they don't sell stocks or receive dividends. They can borrow against their wealth to finance living expenses. Then, when they die, those appreciated assets aren't taxed as capital gains, meaning they can pass the assets down to their children without paying any taxes.\u00a0 Now, the U.S. Congress is working on proposals, hoping to plug the loophole in the tax system. The widening income gap between the rich and the poor in the United States has been a problem for decades and even more so under the pandemic. The issue is more than just the tax system. It is also about social justice and education opportunities. To narrow the income gap is one major task for President Biden. We will see how he plans to tackle the issue.

Influencers, such as the D'Amelio family and Tana Mongeau, have started to post paid advertisements on their social media platforms for different digital coins and exchanges. Even Kim Kardashian West posted an ad for ethereummax on her Instagram story on Sunday to her 228 million followers. Followed by a short clip of her speaking to her camera about ethereummax with \"#ad\" written at the bottom of the screen, Kardashian West posted text: \"Are you guys into crypto???\" \"This is not financial advice but sharing what my friends told me about the ethereum max token!\" the post read. She again added different hashtags, including #ad, which is required to reveal that her post is paid for, along with #emax and #disrupthistory. Other celebrities, including Floyd Mayweather, have endorsed ethereummax as well. Mayweather brought up the altcoin during the Bitcoin 2021 Conference earlier this month and was, in turn, booed off stage. Ethereummax also sponsored Mayweather's recent fight with YouTuber Jake Paul. Ethereummax is an altcoin that redistributes a small percentage of transactions to its token holders. It launched in May with a total supply of 2 quadrillion. However, despite its star-studded partnerships, ethereummax is viewed as a more risky cryptocurrency to some in the crypto world. As Decrypt points out, it's \"mostly just a marketing campaign.\"\u2060 Ethereummax doesn't have a white paper as other crypto projects do, and only a few details about its developers are known. (The ethereummax team did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It's request for comment.) Though it's unknown how much Kardashian West was paid for the advertisement, a 2019 court filing revealed that she can reportedly earn between $300,000 and $500,000 for a single Instagram post. For long-term social media deals, she can sometimes earn millions of dollars. (Kardashian West did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It's request for comment.) Gen Z and young millennial influencers \u2014 many of which primarily have young followers \u2014 have posted paid ads for cryptocurrencies and exchanges recently as well. The family account of TikTok stars Charli, 17, and Dixie D'Amelio, 19, posted their partnership with cryptocurrency exchange Gemini on Instagram in May, Insider reported. \"We are learning more about cryptocurrency as a family, thank you @gemini for Charli's birthday gift. #GeminiPartner,\" the post read, though Gemini has an age requirement of 18 or older. The family's account has over 934,000 followers on Instagram, but Charli and Dixie have even larger followings themselves. Charli has over 117 million followers on TikTok and over 42 million on Instagram. Dixie has over 52 million followers on TikTok and over 24 million on Instagram. \"We believe it's important to provide financial literacy and access to educational resources about cryptocurrency through various channels,\" a spokesperson for Gemini tells CNBC Make It. \"Gemini also works with influencers ... to help educate their followers about cryptocurrencies and raise awareness about the Gemini brand.\" Along with the D'Amelio family, YouTubers like Paul and Loren Gray have posted endorsements for different cryptocurrencies and exchanges to their millions of followers. Even Matt James, known as the first Black male lead on ABC's \"The Bachelor,\" has posted on his social media about his partnership with crypto financial services company BlockFi. Though all cryptocurrency is considered to be a risky, volatile investment, the altcoins being pushed out by these influencers, like ethereummax, require even more caution, experts warn. Especially when advertised to younger audiences. This kind of endorsement can be extra problematic when it isn't made clear that the influencer has been paid to post, James Ledbetter, editor of fintech newsletter FIN and\u00a0CNBC\u00a0contributor\u200b, tells CNBC Make It. \"As with many other products and services these days, a cryptocurrency or exchange paying social media influencers can be an effective way to get the word out,\" he says.  However, \"I'd be concerned that at least some of that audience is both financially unsophisticated and has limited access to funds, which is why this has for years been an area of regulatory action.\" Investors should always do their own research before deciding where to put their money. As the SEC warned in 2017, \"it is never a good idea\u00a0to make an investment decision just because someone famous says\u00a0a product or service\u00a0is a good investment.\" \"These types of arrangements could potentially harm investors, as well as attract regulatory scrutiny for the crypto companies,\" Ledbetter says. But after seeing the effect that Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's tweets have had on cryptocurrencies and stocks, it shouldn't be surprising that companies in the space are trying to find more players to do the same, Ledbetter says. \"Through crypto-memes and Elon Musk, my sense is that a good portion of [young investors have] already been exposed to cryptocurrency,\" Ledbetter says. \"But it's conceivable that influencers might accelerate that trend.\" Sign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter Don't miss: Younger investors are calling bitcoin 'boomer coin'\u2013why they prefer dogecoin and other altcoins "}, {"source": "CNBC", "title": "Why does bitcoin use so much energy?

Anything above 50 is still considered positive. \"Higher costs and declining availability for softwood lumber and other building materials pushed down builder sentiment in June,\" said NAHB Chairman Chuck Fowke, a homebuilder from Tampa, Florida. \"These higher costs have moved some new homes beyond the budget of prospective buyers, which has slowed the strong pace of home building.\" Producer prices rose at their fastest annual clip in nearly 11 years in May as inflation continued to build in the U.S. economy, the Labor Department reported Tuesday. The 6.6% surge was the biggest 12-month rise in the final demand index since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking the data in November 2010. On a monthly basis, the producer price index for final demand rose 0.8%, ahead of the Dow Jones estimate of 0.5%. Bitcoin's price hopped over $40,000 on Monday following\u00a0bullish comments\u00a0by billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones. \"I like\u00a0bitcoin\u00a0as a portfolio\u00a0diversifier.

Here's why these crashes may be happening. One of the reasons for weekend cryptocurrency volatility is there are fewer trades, said Amin Shams, assistant professor of finance at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. \"When the volume is low, the same trade size can move prices a lot more,\" he said. With banks closed over the weekend, there is less trading because investors may not be able to add money to their accounts, McKeon said.

How experts find it \"You get moments of market panic where there's a lot of selling pressure,\" he said.\u00a0 Typically, there's a rebound on Sunday night as Asian banks open and into Monday as U.S. banks follow, McKeon said.\u00a0 Plus, there are cryptocurrency influencers like Tesla CEO Elon Musk who \"wave a heavy hand over the crypto space,\" said Tyrone Ross, CEO of Onramp Invest in New York. When Musk tweets something negative about bitcoin after-hours, it may spark a wave of activity. Another reason for weekend price swings may be investors trading cryptocurrency on margin, which is borrowing money from the exchanges to buy more assets, Shams said. When digital currency prices dip below a certain level, traders must repay the loan, known as a \"margin call.\"\u00a0 But if investors don't cover the loan, exchanges may sell the digital currency to ensure they receive the borrowed money back.

Top strategist David Roche outlines his play for hedging against inflation JPMorgan says there's weak bitcoin demand from big investors, crypto bear market could be on the way With banks closed over the weekend, some traders may struggle to pay off the borrowed funds because they can't move money into their accounts, triggering sell-offs from exchanges, Shams said.\u00a0 \"That's going to drop the price further,\" he added. It's also possible those trying to artificially influence cryptocurrency prices may be a factor.\u00a0 \"There are a lot of studies that show there is [market] manipulation,\" said Shams. For example, 2019 research shows how tether, a digital currency tied to the U.S. dollar, may have artificially inflated bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices during the 2017 boom. But researchers still don't know the extent to which it happens, he said.\u00a0 One theory points to so-called spoofing, involving fake buy or sell orders to influence cryptocurrency prices by creating a false sense of supply and demand.\u00a0 Some believe this happens more often during the week, causing digital currency prices to rise. But this theory may only be speculation, he said. Other experts say there are \"mixed views\" on these practices.\u00a0 \"I have not personally seen any conclusive evidence that suggests manipulation,\" McKeon said. Regardless of the reason for weekend volatility, it presents challenges for regulators weighing the approval of cryptocurrency-based exchange-traded funds. While ETFs trade during the work week, investors can buy or sell cryptocurrency 24 hours per day, seven days per week, and may create a mismatch for crypto ETFs, Shams said. For example, if the digital currency market drops by 20% on a Sunday, those eager to sell may be stuck with their crypto ETFs until the markets open again on Monday.\u00a0 Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has called for greater investor protections for cryptocurrency, signaling more regulation may be necessary before the agency approves crypto ETFs.\u00a0 The SEC is currently reviewing bitcoin and ethereum ETF applications from several companies.

The \u00c4ngelholm, Sweden-based company is experimenting with ultra-high-voltage battery packs and biofuels using emissions from\u00a0volcanoes to build\u00a0environmentally \u201cbenign\u201d and potentially even carbon-neutral cars, without sacrificing performance. Founded in 1994, Koenigsegg has slowly ramped up output of its vehicles to around 35 units a year. The company\u00a0sells to the super rich in search of cutting-edge technology, exclusivity\u00a0and hand-craftmanship using\u00a0the lightest\u00a0bespoke\u00a0materials. In the midst of a global pandemic, Koenigsegg\u2019s already-small\u00a0volume\u00a0was hampered, and the global\u00a0shortage of semiconductors has not helped. However, Koenigsegg\u00a0has big ambitions for a next phase: to double its factory footprint within two to three years and expand production capacity to thousands of cars a year. To achieve that, von Koenigsegg has turned to former Tesla executive Evan\u00a0Horetsky, who oversaw the construction of the electric-car maker\u2019s factories in Reno, Nevada,\u00a0and Shanghai. Von Koenigsegg has tasked Horetsky with dramatically changing the company\u2019s footprint and bringing its technology to a much greater volume of models and drivetrains. As chief industrialization officer, he\u2019s seeking\u00a0a site for a new factory to bring\u00a0Koenigsegg\u2019s history of vertical integration and investment in technology to a much broader audience. Here are excerpts from a discussion with von Koenigsegg and Horetsky, edited for length and clarity: Christian von Koenigsegg:\u00a0I started Koenigsegg in 1994 when I was 22 years old. I had a dream since I was a young boy to build my own car, preferably a sports car,\u00a0and I started my first company when I was 19;\u00a0that is the holding company within our group today. It took me eight years to go from dream to delivering the first record-beating production car in 2002, and since then we have done eight\u00a0different models and been growing all the time. Now, we\u2019re growing a little bit faster and have parallel models in production and different types of cars and different types of mobility projects in the pipeline, as well. Evan Horetsky:\u00a0I started my career with the U.S. Navy doing research integration. From there I had a bit of a gap where I\u00a0was part of a four-person startup building autonomous boats. Then I got the call from Tesla with the crazy idea to focus on the machine that builds the machine, or in other words, think of a factory as a product. That took\u00a0me to Reno, Nevada, where I helped design and build the gigafactory. I then went to Shanghai for about nine months. I most recently led the effort for Gigafactory Berlin. Now I\u2019m here with\u00a0Koenigsegg with the ambition alongside\u00a0Christian to scale up, diversify the product portfolio and\u00a0get deeper into different forms of future mobility and see what we can create. Q: Koenigsegg says it\u2019s propulsion agnostic. What do you mean by that? CVK: If we take a pure electric sports car, they tend to be quite heavy because you need a quite large battery to have enough range and performance. That goes against the sporty nature of the car. We electrify in a different way with more extreme cell technology for power output. And then we have extreme combustion-engine technology running on renewable fuels, but very good aftertreatment systems, and our free-valve technology\u00a0where we can really make sure we combust extremely efficiently with very small engines to make the car lighter, more exciting, have better performance, but still being environmentally benign. What we mean by agnostic is that we mix and match whatever makes the most sense at each given time and for each model. We\u2019re not\u00a0stuck in traditional combustion technology. The technology we develop there is really next-generation beyond anything else I\u2019ve seen out in the marketplace, and also next-generation electrification, and combining these technologies in an interesting way to make our product stand out and be as competitive as we can with as little environmental footprint as possible. You don\u2019t have to pollute the planet just because you want to have a fast, interesting sports car. What is the challenge in changing Koeniggseg and how it builds cars? EH: Koenigsegg has hasn\u2019t acted as much like the typical automotive manufacturers in that they also applied a lot of vertical integration to what they\u2019re doing. In-house composites, software and\u00a0hardware. This was similar at Tesla, too.\u00a0 With Koenigsegg, we\u2019re going to expand the in-house capabilities to more electrification platforms, to motors, batteries, inverters and maybe other electronics. We will also look at different ways we can impact the world with mobility solutions and a lot of those are going to have to be higher volume than the hypercar does right now. Why is Koenigsegg interested in volcanoes? CVK: It\u2019s a\u00a0very interesting way of creating an environmental benign propulsion\u00a0energy source. So there is this technology from Iceland, it was invented there, where they cap the CO2 emittance from semi-active volcanoes and convert that into methanol. And if you take that methanol and you power the plants that do the conversion of other fuels and then power the ship that transports the those fuels to Europe or the U.S. or Asia, wherever it goes, you put the fuel completely CO2-neutral into the vehicle. And of course with the correct aftertreatment systems, depending on the environment you\u2019re in, you can kind of clean up the particles in the atmosphere while you\u2019re using the engine. So you can be very much environmentally conscious doing that. It\u2019s just a fun aspect of renewable fuels that are not talked so much about, but there are many, many other technologies that are coming up. What do you hope to achieve from this point? EH: Within two or\u00a0three years, roughly,\u00a0we should have more than doubled our factory footprint. We should have designed capacity for the thousands of cars per year versus tens or hundreds, and we should have an ability to be highly flexible on our technological innovations within a production line. There\u2019s a bit of a diamond-in-the-rough here, with extreme technical maturity and technical talent\u00a0throughout Koenigsegg, that I think could do more in the world. The Tesla Model S Plaid\u00a0can do zero-to-60 in less than two seconds and it costs $130,000. Why should someone buy a $3 million supercar that uses these different technologies and fuel sources? CVK: That type of performance is becoming kind of a non-competitive aspect for our extreme megacars. It\u2019s an obvious thing to have, especially with all the electric cars coming out like Tesla. What you\u2019re getting when you\u2019re buying an extreme\u00a0hypercar or megacar from us or one of our competitors is something completely hand-built. It\u2019s a bespoke piece of art with performance that can\u00a0beat those cheaper electrical cars in a straight line.\u00a0But then you have to also realize they\u2019re 500 or 600 kilograms\u00a0lighter. So when you turn and when you break and when you drive around a race track, you still get a huge performance difference. It\u2019s more than performance. It\u2019s\u00a0the hand-built aspect, the bespoking, the unique surfacing, the unique materials to make it light. For sure,\u00a0there is a right to exist for these unique cars. They\u2019re works of art, really. \u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.

BloombergNEF analysts expect global annual passenger EV sales rising to 14 million in 2025 from 3.1 million in 2020 and lithium-battery demand growing rapidly to approach 4.5TWh annually by 2035. This year \u201cmarks the first major increase to our EV adoption outlook in the last five years,\u201d driven by factors like rising policy support, accelerated investments and rising consumer adoption, BloombergNEF analysts wrote in a report. \u201cMeeting this demand requires unprecedented but achievable increases in materials, components and cell production.\u201d Chinese firms reported better-than-expected EV sales last month. Reuters reported that Apple Inc. is in early talks with CATL and BYD Co. about battery supply for its electric vehicle. Electric vehicle maker BYD, which traded Thursday without the right to receive the next dividend, jumped about 6% in Hong Kong, while solar module maker LONGi Green Energy Technology Co. rose as much as 7.8%. Battery material suppliers, Guangzhou Tinci Materials Technology Co. gained as much as 7.1% and Tianqi Lithium Corp. surged 3.6%. \u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.

Musk paid no federal income taxes in 2018 and less than US$70,000 in 2015 and 2017, according to the report. An IRS official said last week that the disclosure of the data for billionaires including Bloomberg LP founder Michael Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, has been referred to Federal Bureau of Investigation investigators. After the ProPublica report, Musk tweeted that he will keep paying income taxes in California in proportion with his time in the state, which he said will be significant. He moved to Texas last year and said he now rents a roughly US$50,000 house in Boca Chica from Space Exploration Technologies Corp., which has a launch site in the area.

The Westly Group, which led a funding round with five other venture capital firms, invested $14 million in Circulor Ltd., according to a Thursday statement from the London-based startup. Circulor said it will use the investment for ongoing innovation and to extend its presence in North America and Asia. Circulor is tapping into growing interest from companies seeking to ensure their operations can stand up to scrutiny on environmental and social issues. Manufacturers and automakers face increasing pressure from investors on how they source raw materials and produce products. Mining investors are particularly keen on ensuring that battery metals including cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper are produced ethically and in an environmentally friendly way amid a global push to reduce pollution in worldwide economies. Circulor has already sold its product to the electric vehicle industry, helping automakers and suppliers track materials such as cobalt, mica and lithium, the statement said. The firm traces other commodities, including nickel, copper, plastics and leather, and is also used in areas such as the remanufacturing of auto parts. Existing investors include the venture arms of airplane-builder Boeing Co., Swedish automaker Volvo AG and miner BHP Group. Companies including BHP, Polestar and Vulcan Energy Resources Ltd. are using Circulor\u2019s technology to track and manage supply chains, support responsible sourcing and analyze supply-chain emissions. \u201cThe real driver is a combination of consumer pressure and institutional capital wanting to see meaningful ESG progress,\u201d Circulor Chief Executive Officer Douglas Johnson\u2011Poensgen\u200b said in an interview.

At a gala dinner in Shanghai, the founder of Chinese electric carmaker Nio Inc. can barely move forward in the buffet queue before being stopped for another selfie, handshake or hug. Swapping his usual attire of jeans and a T-shirt for a tailored grey suit and blue dress shirt, the tall 46-year-old happily obliges with a smile. Li manages to spoon a small amount of fried rice and vegetables onto his plate, but he\u2019s not here for the food. Over the next three hours, Li\u00a0poses for hundreds more photos, chatting with customers of the automaker\u00a0he started\u00a0just over six years ago and has built into a way of life \u2014\u00a0at least for the people who buy his cars \u2014\u00a0with clubhouses, a round-the-clock battery recharging service and even clothing, food and exercise equipment, all decked out in Nio\u2019s geometric logo. As Li works the room, a video backdrop shows six performers, each wearing a different-colored Nio hoodie, singing a self-composed song dedicated to the company. \u201cMeeting with Nio, we want to be better selves,\u201d the not-so-catchy ditty goes. While other billionaire executives may cringe at spending their down time glad-handing customers, for Li this is core. Nio\u2019s\u00a0business model relies on creating a\u00a0sense of allegiance among buyers, who then persuade friends and family to spread the word about its\u00a0cars. Dubbed \u201cRippling Mode,\u201d the strategy invokes the ever-widening circles caused by throwing a single stone into a pond, Li says. The scene in Shanghai was just what he\u00a0was aiming for: a passionate customer base with the loyalty of Apple Inc. fans\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and a dash of Elon Musk cult-of-personality thrown in. It\u2019s an approach that\u2019s turned Nio into Musk\u2019s most visible nemesis in a country that seems to be minting\u00a0Tesla adversaries\u00a0every other day. While other electric vehicle companies may pump out more cars\u00a0aimed at the mass market, Nio is targeting the\u00a0premium buyers that Musk \u2014\u00a0who established his first Gigafactory outside the U.S. on the outskirts of Shanghai in 2019\u00a0\u2014\u00a0needs to realize his ambitions for global growth and long-term profitability. China is ground-zero in the transition away from gas-guzzlers to alternative-energy cars, with the government intent on dominating a new automotive era that has triggered an onslaught of investment over the past six months and that even the U.S. is now embracing. The biggest car market on the planet, China is already the world\u2019s largest for EVs. Sales will reach 2 million this year and surge to 6.2 million vehicles by 2025, when they will account for a quarter of all passenger car sales in the country, according to BloombergNEF.\u00a0 Urbane, early adopters in China\u2019s biggest cities have been at the heart of that transition, and are prime targets for both Nio and Tesla. Nio\u2019s premium ES6 SUV competes head-to-head with the sporty Model Y that\u00a0Tesla started making in China last year. It\u2019s a tussle that\u2019s front and center for Li, who in an interview with Bloomberg talked about how the eldest of his two sons, a first grader, wants to follow in his footsteps.\u00a0 \u201cOne day he told me that he would study hard and work hard, helping dad beat Tesla when he grows up,\u201d said Li. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be too late, I said.\u201d These days, that prospect is looking less like wishful thinking. Nio delivered more than 20,000 vehicles, all of them SUVs,\u00a0in the first quarter at an average price of $68,000, while Tesla shipped\u00a0around 17,000 of its Model Y sports utility vehicle in China, which\u00a0starts at\u00a0around $53,000.\u00a0Nio\u2019s share of the overall China market for higher end\u00a0cars is second only to Tesla, according to Kang Jun, an analyst at consultancy LMC Automotive, and it\u2019s set a \u201cbenchmark\u201d\u00a0for the wider EV space, \u201cparticularly in product and service innovation.\u201d Tesla\u00a0has also faced a raft of setbacks of late in China, which accounted for more than 20% of all revenue last year. Increased scrutiny from local regulators has been accompanied by a rising backlash against Tesla and its cars, culminating in one owner climbing on top of a Model 3 at the recent Shanghai Auto Show, claiming the company failed to address issues with her vehicle\u2019s brakes. The protest, which went viral in China, unleashed a wave of complaints about Tesla\u2019s customer service, the very thing Li \u2014\u00a0who regularly\u00a0replies to queries from Nio owners on the company\u2019s app and has taken\u00a0weekend trips across China to meet customers \u2014\u00a0has used to differentiate Nio in the cut-throat EV landscape. But Tesla isn\u2019t the only foe\u00a0Li has to worry about. A Battle Royale is brewing in China\u2019s\u00a0new energy car market \u2014\u00a0where retail sales of battery-powered passenger vehicles\u00a0jumped 10% to 1.11 million\u00a0last year, despite the\u00a0hit from the pandemic \u2014\u00a0one that will challenge both Nio and Tesla, and set the stage for global control over the future of cars. After years watching from the sidelines, the big auto-making giants are doubling down on EVs, with Volkswagen AG launching an eight-car range from its platform designed for battery electric cars\u00a0in China, Toyota Motor Corp. unveiling a new EV\u00a0platform, and premium carmakers like BMW AG aiming for\u00a0one-quarter\u00a0of all Chinese sales to be electric. At the same time, Big Tech is eyeing the sector, lured by the technological possibilities. Chinese search-engine titan Baidu Inc. to smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. and networks giant Huawei Technologies Co. have pledged almost $19 billion into the EV and autonomous driving space since the start of the year alone. Smaller companies like Nio \u2014\u00a0which is listed with compatriots Xpeng Inc. and Li Auto Inc. in New York, putting them on the radar of U.S. investors \u2014\u00a0will face greater pressure as multinationals enter the fray, said Zhang Xiang, an auto-industry researcher at North China University of Technology in Beijing. \u201cIt\u2019s by no means a time they can rest easy.\u201d Nio has already had one near-death experience. Carmaking is typically a capital-intensive business, but with Nio, Li has sought to create a brand beyond the vehicles, an approach he describes as \u201cthe pursuit of being a user-enterprise.\u201d The most visible manifestation of that was the\u00a0Nio House,\u00a0an elite drop-in center for the company\u2019s customers \u2014\u00a0even offering art and music classes for their kids \u2014\u00a0and located on prime real estate in some of China\u2019s biggest cities. It was coupled with extravagant marketing events. The carmaker holds annual Nio Days,\u00a0and at the first in 2017 paid for flights and luxury\u00a0hotels for\u00a0everyone who\u00a0ordered a vehicle a year before production started. R&B star Bruno Mars headlined the 2018 event. When its public charging facilities are\u00a0overwhelmed, Nio has\u00a0a fleet of cars that can\u00a0take portable battery chargers to users wherever they\u2019re\u00a0parked. Such largesse, along with a\u00a0major recall\u00a0after some cars caught fire\u00a0just\u00a0as China shifted subsidies from EV purchases to support the charging network, saw Nio rack up $5 billion of losses in its first four years of existence (Tesla took about 15 years to reach that particular milestone). By the second quarter of 2019, the company was losing around $5 million a day.\u00a0 \u201cIt was our darkest time,\u201d Li said. A team met nightly to comb through expenses, from salaries to the cost of Nio Houses. \u201cIt was easy to calculate how much we could earn from selling cars, but we had to mind for everything to sustain a normal operation,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery dollar counted.\u201d By October 2019, it looked like the gig was up. After posting a worse-than-expected quarterly loss, Nio\u2019s shares plunged to a record low of $1.32. At its nadir, the carmaker had lost more than 70% of its market capitalization \u2014\u00a0about $5 billion in value\u00a0\u2014\u00a0from\u00a0its New York initial public offering a year earlier. Even a $200 million cash injection from a sale of convertible notes to Li and an affiliate of Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. \u2014\u00a0an early investor in both Nio and Tesla \u2014 wasn\u2019t enough to shore up the company\u2019s seemingly insatiable need for cash. The setbacks kept coming. Nio couldn\u2019t afford the final payment on an imported\u00a0stamping presser, a large machine used to shape a car\u2019s panels. Worse, it had to sell the presser at a discount to Tesla, which promptly installed it in its new Shanghai plant, built with loans and support facilitated\u00a0 by the government. Soon after, a deal for as much as 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) in funding from a Beijing local government-backed firm fell apart. Analysts started to openly speculate that Nio may be delisted or taken over. The situation got so dire that in late 2019, He Xiaopeng, the engineer founder of Guangzhou-based Xpeng, itself in a tenuous position with just 3 billion yuan in cash, proposed a merger of the two struggling electric carmakers, according to an interview He gave to Chinese state media. Li rejected the offer. \u201cNio was already in the intensive care unit, while Xpeng was waiting outside,\u201d Li recalled. \u201cA merger would bury both of us.\u201d Then came the lifeline that showed the lengths China will go to maintain its ambition of creating a world-leading EV industry. In early 2020, the municipal government in Hefei \u2014\u00a0the capital of Li\u2019s home province of Anhui, about 600 miles southeast of Beijing \u2014\u00a0came knocking. Despite the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, which initially paralyzed car sales, a deal was struck in which the Hefei government would lead an injection of 10 billion yuan into Nio, more than the company\u2019s entire revenue for 2019. Coming just months after Nio said it wouldn\u2019t have enough money to\u00a0 continue operating\u00a0for another year unless it got more funds, the agreement\u00a0essentially provided the company with a state-backed security blanket. That can be\u00a0a key advantage in China, where the government is the biggest player in almost every industry and has a hand in everything from manufacturing permits to access to capital. It\u00a0could also provide a decisive edge over Tesla, which seems to have lost the favor it enjoyed early on with Beijing, as tensions with Washington continue to simmer under President Joe Biden\u2019s administration.\u00a0 For Nio, the quid-pro-quo was supporting local industry. The company abandoned plans to build a factory in Shanghai in early 2019, and instead \u2014\u00a0unlike Tesla and most traditional automakers \u2014\u00a0it pays a government-owned manufacturer in Hefei called Jianghuai Automobile Group Co., or JAC, to make its cars. The deal was extended last month\u00a0for another three years, with JAC agreeing to double monthly capacity to 20,000 vehicles. \u201cWhen William Li brought his proposal to us, most people thought it was fantasy that a Chinese carmaker planned to build first-rate intelligent electric vehicles,\u201d former JAC Chairman An Jin said. \u00a0\u201cI might be the person with the best knowledge of how Nio came along, with all the challenges and difficulties. In its hardest time, William even devoted his own money to solve the problem. That\u2019s how he fought for his dreams.\u201d At an April 7 ceremony to mark the production of Nio\u2019s 100,000th vehicle, Li said he would work with the Hefei government to establish an intelligent-vehicle production base, including an R&D facility. Construction started later that month, and the industrial park is expected to eventually house manufacturing workshops, along with other players in the EV supply chain. The Hefei pact,\u00a0described as a government bailout by Sanford C. Bernstein\u2019s senior analyst Robin Zhu,\u00a0\u201cput speculation around Nio\u2019s funding issues to bed, at least in the foreseeable future,\u201d he said. Li, though, also credits his loyal customer base. \u201cWe sold over 8,000 cars in the fourth quarter of 2019, which was pivotal to our survival,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I always say that our customers saved us. Even if we sold 500 or 1,000 fewer vehicles, that could have triggered a total collapse.\u201d\u00a0 Still, the experience was chastening. Nio cut about a quarter of its workforce, slowed its efforts\u00a0on autonomous driving, delayed wage payments for managers and spun off some non-core businesses. While the rollout of the costly Nio Houses was suspended for more than a year, the strategy of\u00a0putting Nio ownership at the center of an owners\u2019 lifestyle and creating an aura of exclusivity, wasn\u2019t forsaken\u00a0with more modest Nio Spaces\u00a0rolled out. Usually around 100-200 square meters (1,100-2,150 square feet), Nio Spaces are located in cheaper locales and also sometimes in smaller cities. They\u00a0cost about 1 million yuan to set up, much less expensive\u00a0than the more salubrious Nio Houses. It seems to have worked \u2014\u00a0for now. Nio is still yet to turn a profit but\u00a0its sales have risen steadily since \u2014\u00a0topping $1 billion for the first time in the three months to Dec. 31, 2020. The company narrowed its net loss in the first quarter of 2021 to 451 million yuan, down from 1.69 billion yuan a year earlier and 1.39 billion yuan in the fourth quarter of 2020. Even the\u00a0businesses that underpin Nio\u2019s lifestyle brand are making money, contributing to 1.1 billion yuan in revenue from non-vehicle sales last year,\u00a0according to the company\u2019s annual report. \u201cTo enter the car industry and survive isn\u2019t easy,\u201d said Jochen Goller, BMW\u2019s China CEO. \u201cSome others have disappeared. I have met with William Li a couple of times and I have to say I am impressed by what he has achieved. Nio is also creating awareness for battery cars, and having the right brands in the segment is helping the market.\u201d The Hefei deal also came around the same time as investors cottoned on to the EV revolution, putting a rocket under Nio\u2019s shares. They surged more than 1,110% last year, besting even the rally that propelled Tesla into the S&P 500 Index. The stock has given up some of those gains since as enthusiasm has eased, but with a market value of $70 billion, Nio is still bigger than Ford Motor Co. It\u2019s a long way from Li\u2019s relatively humble beginnings. Raised by his grandparents in a small village in the hills of Anhui, known for farming and \u2014\u00a0more recently \u2014\u00a0the automobile industry, Li calls himself one of China\u2019s \u201cfirst generation of `left-behind\u2019 children\u201d because both his parents moved to the neighboring province of Jiangsu\u00a0to pursue better work. There was no electricity in the village until Li was in his teens.\u00a0 While majoring in sociology at Peking University, one of China\u2019s top colleges, Li started his first business \u2014\u00a0leasing internet servers and helping clients register domain names. The auto industry is where Li has enjoyed his greatest success, however, with the three listed companies he founded in the past 20 years all related to cars. His first, a vehicle-pricing portal called BitAuto Holdings Ltd. was acquired last year by Yiche Holding Ltd. for $2.8 billion, propelling Li\u2019s personal fortune to $7 billion.\u00a0That was followed by online auto-finance platform Yixin Group Ltd., which listed in Hong Kong in late 2017. Then came Nio. In an internal presentation in 2016, Li recalled looking out the window of his apartment at Beijing\u2019s smoggy skies before the birth of his first son, and decided something needed to be done to tackle the country\u2019s chronic pollution. He started Nio in late 2014\u00a0with funding from a group of well-known investors, including Li Auto founder Li Xiang and Richard Liu, the founder of e-commerce portal JD.com. Xiaomi\u2019s Lei Jun was also an early backer. When he\u2019s not dining with super-fans, Li\u2019s workday calendar is packed. On a recent Tuesday at the company\u2019s corporate headquarters \u2014\u00a0which remain in the slick financial capital of Shanghai \u2014\u00a0he spent the morning locked in executive committee meetings. In the afternoon, it was more back-to-back meetings with the company\u2019s battery partner, designers, and clients from Europe. In a first, Nio recently announced plans to start selling cars in EV hotbed Norway. But while the company is on much firmer ground than\u00a018 months ago, questions remain. \u201cAuto manufacturing has big economies of scale, and at less than 100,000 units a year, Nio hasn\u2019t yet reached the production volume to realize all of those efficiencies,\u201d said Robert Cowell, an equity analyst at Shanghai-based 86Research. Cost issues linger, with the price of raw materials used in batteries, the most expensive part of an EV, including lithium-ion compound, soaring in recent months. Like most global automakers, Nio has also been hit by a worldwide shortage of the chips used increasingly in modern cars, leading to the suspension of production in Hefei for five days at the end of March. And despite the intensifying competition in an industry defined by technological advances and consumers drawn to the next shiny thing, Nio isn\u2019t planning on unveiling any new models until late this year or early 2022. Read more: Why Nio Should Resist the Siren Song of Norway While Tesla is the main competitor in view, it\u2019s the rivals to come that Li sees as the biggest threat. \u201cThe final game won\u2019t start until tech giants are in,\u201d he said. In March,\u00a0Xiaomi unveiled plans to invest about $10 billion in manufacturing EVs, while Huawei has collaborated on at least two cars and is developing autonomous driving technologies.\u00a0Lurking in the background is the biggest tech giant of all \u2014\u00a0Apple, which has long harbored ambitions to make its own, self-driving car. \u201cI trust companies like Apple for their determination, software development, intelligence capability, and user connection,\u201d Li said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be different competition from traditional car companies.\u201d\u00a0 But like Musk and other EV evangelists, Li is looking to the long game.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m very optimistic,\u201d he said. \u201cBy 2030, 90% of the newly launched cars will be electric, or even 95%.\u201d For the Nio fans gathered in Shanghai that Sunday evening, that future is already here. With\u00a0the event drawing\u00a0to a close, owners pose for a large group photo with Li at its center, everyone flashing thumbs up. As the lights dim, Li slips out of the hall and into the night, where his driver \u2014\u00a0in a white Nio ES8 \u2014\u00a0waits to take him home. \u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.

Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted on Sunday that the electric carmarker will resume allowing bitcoin transactions when miners who verify transactions use more renewable energy. Musk has been a major promoter of cryptocurrencies but has turned critical of bitcoin since suspending Tesla plans to take it in payment for cars, owing to concerns that the computers used to \u201cmine\u201d it use too much energy. \u201cWhen there\u2019s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions,\u201d he said in the tweet.

The technology giant hired Kranz in recent weeks, about a month after he stepped down as chief executive officer of Canoo Inc., a developer of self-driving electric vehicles. Before co-founding Canoo, Kranz was senior vice president of the group that developed the i3 and i8 cars at BMW, where he worked for 30 years. Kranz is one of Apple\u2019s most significant automotive hires, a clear sign that the iPhone maker is determined to build a self-driving electric car to rival Tesla Inc. and other carmakers. Kranz will report to Doug Field, who led development of Tesla\u2019s mass-market Model 3 and now runs Apple\u2019s car project, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter. Apple has become the world\u2019s most valuable company, with a market capitalization of more than $2 trillion, by selling iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, Macs and services. With investors and customers clamoring for new products, the company has targeted cars and augmented-reality headsets. An Apple spokesperson confirmed Kranz\u2019s hiring. Apple began developing a vehicle in 2014 but shelved the effort around 2016 to focus on an autonomous platform it could sell to other companies or eventually use itself. Along the way, Apple poached several Tesla executives, who now help head up drive-train engineering, self-driving software and interiors and exteriors. Last year, Apple gave oversight of the operation to John Giannandrea, senior vice president of machine learning and artificial intelligence and Field\u2019s boss. Several months ago, Apple rebooted its efforts to develop a full-fledged electric car, but development remains in the early stages, so a launch is likely at least five years away. Before hiring Kranz, Apple lost some key auto executives. Benjamin Lyon, Jaime Waydo and Dave Scott, who worked on engineering, safety systems and robotics, respectively, all departed in recent months. It\u2019s unclear why the three left. Following successful stints at BMW\u2019s Mini division and teams working on sports cars and SUVs, Kranz was asked to run Project I, a battery-powered vehicle skunkworks started in 2008. It yielded the all-electric i3 compact and the plug-in hybrid i8 sports car. The former was panned by design critics, and production was very limited on the latter. Kranz left BMW in 2016 and soon became chief technology officer at Faraday Future, an electric vehicle startup based in Los Angeles. He stayed only three months, before co-founding Canoo. Both firms have struggled with their technology and ability to produce vehicles, while Canoo reportedly discussed selling itself to Apple and other companies. Canoo went public in December after a reverse merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, called Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. Canoo last month said it was being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, becoming the third clean-energy auto startup to disclose a federal probe in the past year. Canoo plans to debut a minivan for less than $35,000 next year. Apple has worked with BMW for many years, integrating the iPod with auto infotainment systems back in 2004 and more recently making the iPhone double as a car key. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook was spotted checking out a BMW i8 outside Apple\u2019s Cupertino, California, headquarters in 2014, and company executives have been known to visit BMW offices in recent years. \u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.

Meanwhile, the race to catch up to Tesla is in full swing. Let\u2019s start with Tesla itself, which just this week announced the unexpected departure of Jerome Guillen, who served as president of heavy trucking and was one of four execs running the company with CEO Elon Musk. Guillen had been with Tesla for a decade, and had previously served as president of Tesla\u2019s automotive business. This might be welcome news for Apple, which has been revving up plans since 2014 to be a rival and added Ulrich Kranz, a former senior executive at BMW AG\u2019s electric car division and founder of Canoo Inc., a developer of self-driving vehicles. It all seems a bit like a race to the moon, no? And Canada isn\u2019t going to be left out in the cold either. Closer to home, Raquel Urtasun, a University of Toronto professor of computer science and world-leading expert in machine learning and computer vision, has left her position as chief scientist at Uber\u2019s ATG self-driving car lab in Toronto to start her own autonomous car company. The startup, called Waabi, will focus on using AI to address the challenges that plague the full commercialization of self-driving technology. Waabi\u00a0announced more than $100 million in funding this week \u2014 one of the largest rounds of initial financing secured by a Canadian startup. Mark her and Waabi as one to watch. Every day, another survey on hybrid work strategy. Which is great; we can\u2019t get enough and returning to the office is a contentious topic. This time, we get feedback from Gen Z. Some workers are all for it\u2014 in a recent poll by Angus Reid for ADP Canada, 36 per cent of the Canadian Gen Zers surveyed were all for the return to their desks \u2014 while others are dreading the post-pandemic shift back to the traditional nine-to-fives they left behind. It\u2019ll all come down to company policy, on an organization-by-organization basis, which may leave employees having to make some tough decisions. Every day, another survey on hybrid work strategy.

It\u2019ll all come down to company policy, on an organization-by-organization basis, which may leave employees having to make some tough decisions. And that\u2019s one reason we love the surveys, because people keep changing their minds. Just ask staffers at Amazon and IBM. Both companies pulled an about-face last week, announcing changes to their previously statements about flexible work schedules in the After Times. While previous reports stated that Amazon was aiming to return to an office-centric culture, corporate Amazon employees will now be allowed to work remotely up to two days a week, with the possibility of working entirely remotely for up to four weeks a year. The company says it\u2019s \u201clearning and evolving as we go\u201d to explain the change of heart. IBM pulled the opposite move: The tech multinational had hinted at hybrid and remote possibilities earlier in the pandemic, but in a memo to staff this week, they announced that they will be reopening all of their American offices this fall, and that staff will be expected to clock-in in person. Citing \u201cimproving U.S. clinical conditions and broad access to COVID-19 vaccines,\u201d the memo advises all staffers to be prepared to return to their physical office spaces the week of September 7. Facebook is splitting the difference. Starting June 15, Facebook will allow employees to request permanent, remote work arrangements. (Previously, only employees with a certain level of seniority could make this ask.) Hybrid work schedules will also be considered for those whose work requires them to be on-site at least some of the time, and expanded remote work access across international borders is on the table for those who are interested in living and working abroad, reports CNBC. Working from away may come at a price with a clawback in salary, though: CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced last summer that remote work could come with compensation adjustments in line with market values. The country is currently living in two worlds: The broader economy, where the unemployment rate is climbing (up to 8.2 per cent in May, with 68,000 jobs lost in the month amidst lockdowns to curb the spread of COVID), and the tech sector, where they can\u2019t hire fast enough. Amazon has announced plans to hire 1,800 employees coast to coast, and across areas of the business, this year. Shopify, Google, Twitter and Pinterest have also announced hiring plans in Canada. Many Canadian startups \u2014 especially those with a focus on digital transformation \u2014 find themselves with a related issue. With an influx of venture capital investment money as the pandemic winds down, some companies are having to hit fast-forward on a hire that was maybe a few years down the road in the original business plan: a Chief Financial Officer. For organizations that are looking to take their companies public, which may happen sooner depending on the windfalls they\u2019ve received of late, having a CFO in place is crucial. Take Snapcommerce, a Toronto-based e-comm promotions startup. The pandemic accelerated interest in the company, and they closed a $107-million round of venture capital funding in March \u2014 four times what they had raised to date. All of a sudden, the company had an immediate need to beef up their lean finance team. In response, the company announced their new CFO hire last week \u2014 Daniel Weisenfeld, former head of investment-retail banking at Bank of America. Co-founder Hussein Fazal says this hire, as well as appointing Anan Kashyap, CFO of Poshmark, to its board, will help to make the company \u201cIPO-ready.\u201d The pandemic accelerated interest in the company, and they closed a $107-million round of venture capital funding in March \u2014 four times what they had raised to date.

In an age where some of your colleagues will have returned to the office while you\u2019re still at home, it can be difficult to stay top of mind, reports Fast Company. So what can you do to stay on the radar? It\u2019s probably not a shock to learn that employees are lonelier than ever. High-quality connections are vital for people to feel socially fulfilled at work, and \u2014 while the idea of the being lonely at work was emerging before COVID-19 \u2014 the isolation of the pandemic has made fostering interpersonal relationships with colleagues even more difficult. (There\u2019s only so much connection you can get over Zoom.) This means that companies will need to commit to psychological safety \u2014 the idea that it\u2019s okay to take personal risks, like asking questions, admitting mistakes and showing vulnerability \u2014 as well as opportunities to encourage empathy and interdependence among teams.

This isn\u2019t just about social events and team-building exercises, either. (Trust falls aren\u2019t going to fix this one.) Teams need to be structured for collaboration, says the Harvard Business Review, and not just baton-passing work. High levels of interactivity, and the sharing of thoughts and resources, will be important. Add in an element of recognition for people who help to foster interpersonal relationship building at work, and workplace loneliness may be something you can leave behind with the pandemic. We\u2019ll tell you what else you can leave behind with the pandemic and the days of never-ending videoconferencing: blue light glasses. These now-popular specs cropped up on so many work-from-home essentials lists over the past year, touting their ability to temper the effects of blue light emitted from screens, but their effectiveness is cloudy (pun absolutely intended). Digital eye strain is definitely a thing, but the amount of blue light emitted from screens is minimal and there\u2019s no evidence to support that it causes structural damage to the eye. In fact, a recent study in the American Journal of Ophthalmology found no difference in the amount of digital eye strain between a test group using blue light glasses and a placebo group. You\u2019d be better off scheduling in breaks from the screen, and not just for your eyes. Burnout is a real thing. Some Chinese millennials are taking a stand against burnout, in fact, in what they\u2019re calling the \u201clying flat\u201d movement. In response to the hyper-competitive rat race in China, groups of people are \u201clying down\u201d by working a job at their own pace and resting when they need to. They\u2019re also refusing to work overtime, avoiding desk jobs and even not getting married and starting families, in order to buck tradition. In a culture where the 9-9-6 expectation is rampant \u2014 working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week \u2014 it\u2019s a revolt against the convention of overwork. Poor enforcement of labour laws sees people suffering from exhaustion and depression, and in extreme cases, dying at their desks.

The senior officer responsible for human resources in the Canadian Armed Forces, Lieutenant-General Steve Whelan, is calling for the military to keep its promise to address sexual misconduct, after numerous reports of inappropriate behaviour involving senior commanders. Whelan, as head of military personnel, has oversight on everything from recruitment and training to promotions and health care, and will be implementing reforms to various areas that will have a direct impact on Armed Forces culture. Proposals for change will come from a variety of channels, including from retired Supreme Court justice Louise Arbour, who has been conducting a year-long study in order to provide strategy for eliminating sexual misconduct. One would think that an apple left atop a stack of papers when workers evacuated the office in haste 15 months ago would be a \u201cpuddle of putrid goo,\u201d but a deputy managing editor at The Atlantic, Rachel Gutman, accidentally figured out that in certain conditions \u2014 in this case, an empty office in the midst of a pandemic \u2014 the rot stays away and desiccation happens instead. In other words, it dries out instead of liquefying. We were immediately drawn to this story and wondered what we could learn to apply to HR insights. Gutman interviewed food scientists to find out exactly what went on with the shrivelled up, raisin-like apple in question, and it seems \u201c\u2026the apple had benefited from a combination of natural decay processes, a fortuitous lack of fungi, and the very particular environmental conditions of an abandoned, climate-controlled office.\u201d In essence, the apple preserved itself.

In some ways, we\u2019ll all be returning to office weirdness, from the now-ancient snacks in your desk drawer to the remote colleague you\u2019ll work with every day but never see. Well, at least in real life. In an effort to cut down on Zoom fatigue (is this an actual diagnosis?) some companies are investigating bringing hologram technology to the workplace. Yep, you read that right. Organizations like WeWork and Google are hoping to bring holograms and related technology to their boardrooms, as a way to improve communication and help interactions to feel more personal.

As part of that spending, the No. 1 U.S. automaker will build two additional U.S. battery plants and move ahead some of its EV investments, said the sources, who asked not to be identified. In November, GM upped its spending plans from $20 billion, a figure that was announced in March before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the auto industry. The Detroit company declined to comment. The expected announcement of increased spending by GM comes less than a month after rival Ford Motor Co upped its EV spending by more than a third to over $30 billion by 2030. The combined $65 billion in commitments by the largest U.S. automakers, as well as increased spending by EV leader Tesla Inc and startups including Lucid and Rivian reflect the EV arms race that has left some automakers like Lordstown Motors Corp scrambling to raise more funds. In addition, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other key Democrats to discuss EVs and vehicle emissions, the sources said. Barra will also meet U.S. Representative Richard Neal, head of the tax policy Ways and Means Committee, Frank Pallone, who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee, and two key Michigan Democrats: Representatives Dan Kildee and Debbie Dingell, the sources said. WOOING WASHINGTON Working with Washington is critical as President Joe Biden has proposed $174 billion to boost EVs and charging as part of his infrastructure plan, including $100 billion in new EV rebates. GM\u2019s ability to benefit from the current $7,500 federal EV tax credit has expired. GM has sparred with Democrats over vehicle emissions rules, but last week said it supported overall emissions reductions in California\u2019s 2019 deal with other major automakers. It has also sought more flexibility to hit carbon reduction target between now and 2026. The Associated Press reported on Monday that GM planned to announce two new U.S. battery plants, citing comments by President Mark Reuss. GM confirmed the executive\u2019s comments, but sources said the company has not decided where in the United States to build the plants, which are each expected to cost more than $2 billion. In January, GM said it was setting a goal to sell all its new cars, SUVs and light pickup trucks with zero tailpipe emissions by 2035, a dramatic shift away from gasoline and diesel engines. GM and its South Korean joint-venture partner, LG Energy Solution, are already building a battery plant in northeastern Ohio and have announced a second, $2.3 billion battery plant will be located in Spring Hill, Tennessee. GM confirmed in November it would speed up the rollout of new EVs, with plans to offer 30 models globally by 2025, up from a prior target of 20 by 2023. Barra said the automaker wants to exceed annual sales of 1 million EVs in the United States and China by 2025. On May 26, a Senate committee advanced legislation that would boost tax credits to as much as $12,500 for EVs assembled by union workers in the United States. The current maximum tax credit is $7,500. The bill also includes a 30% tax credit for manufacturers to retool or build new facilities to produce advanced energy technologies including batteries. That would represent a big boost to GM\u2019s battery factory plans.

The balance of 60 towers will be used to grow premium strawberries for local markets. The Abbotsford showcase greenhouse utilizes Affinor\u2019s soil formulation, QA protocols and processes designed to ensure quality, reduce pathogens and address the microbial issues that the cannabis industry faces globally. Affinor has installed Tesla Powerwalls and Solar Panels, with plans to install closed loop composting equipment. Affinor is also filing new patents for drying and curing vessels, with encompassed process patents. This will ensure stable conditions throughout the process of drying and curing. The company has plans to grow across Canada, and works toward full ESG compliance globally. Affinor\u2019s vertical farming technology levels the playing field for plant production globally. Nick Brusatore CEO: \u201cRevenue from this first facility should begin this year. This will showcase to the world, the Affinor Growers technological advantage in sustainable and automated design.\u201d About Affinor  Affinor is a publicly traded company listed on the CSE under the symbol \u201cAFI\u201d and on the OTCQB under the symbol \u201cRSSFF\u201d.

Thomas Ingenlath told Reuters in a telephone interview that the Polestar 3 is \u201cnicely suited for the U.S. as a \u2026 big, tall, grown-up SUV. This is a win-win situation.\u201d The Volvo plant in Ridgeville, South Carolina, near Charleston, currently builds the Volvo S60 sedan and will add the Volvo XC90 SUV in 2022, Polestar said on Wednesday. The annual capacity at the plant, which opened in 2018, will be 150,000 vehicles with the Volvo and Polestar SUVs added, a Volvo spokesman said. The Polestar 3 will be built on the same electric premium platform, called the SPA2, as the XC90, Ingenlath said. It will compete with such models as Tesla Inc\u2019s Model X SUV. Sweden\u2019s Volvo Cars is owned by Geely. The Polestar SUV will initially be sold in the United States, but could eventually be exported, Ingenlath said. Polestar, which was launched in 2017, sells the low-volume halo Polestar 1 hybrid performance car for about $155,000. Its first high-volume car, the Polestar 2, sells for about $60,000. Both cars are built in China. Ingenlath said last year Polestar was targeting annual Polestar 2 sales of more than 50,000 vehicles within two to three years. He said that goal has not changed, but declined to give volume targets for the Polestar 3. The company also is developing a larger, more environmentally friendly sedan called Precept and will build that vehicle at a new plant in China. Ingenlath said taking Polestar public remained a possibility, but the focus is on raising funds to help the company grow. Last year he said Polestar would like eventually to be publicly listed. In April, Polestar raised $550 million from investors to accelerate product development and said further fund raising could occur.

It\u2019s a question that appeared, at least to some, to already be nearly answered after a handful of trailblazing companies \u2014 including Tesla Inc., MicroStrategy Inc. and Square Inc. \u2014 incorporated Bitcoin into their balance sheets without igniting a broader corporate revolution. Now, the focus is turning to governments. El Salvador, which started using the U.S. dollar as its currency more than 20 years ago, last week became the first country in the world to pass legislation allowing use of Bitcoin in any transaction. President Nayib Bukele says the point is to counter the fact that relatively few citizens have bank accounts and to cut the cost of sending remittances, or money that workers ship back to their families in El Salvador from other countries. Some observers wonder whether a bigger movement is afoot: replacing a conventional currency \u2014 the dollar, the titan of global commerce and finance \u2014 on a national scale and then beyond. The answer, at least for Julian Sawyer, chief executive officer of Bitstamp, one of the world\u2019s longest-running crypto exchanges, is not quite yet. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of people who have sat in the crypto world who\u2019ve said, \u2018Oh, crypto is going to take over the world and traditional banks and central banks will go away,'\u201d he said in a telephone interview from London. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d While the technology itself may be used increasingly in the behind-the-scenes plumbing of financial services, such as money being sent across borders, Sawyer said Bitcoin is still too volatile to fully replace the dollar, though it may become part of the mix. \u201cWill there still be the dollar? Yes,\u201d he said. \u201cWill there still be Visa and Mastercard? Absolutely. It will just be we\u2019ll have alternatives for using plastic, or paper, or coins or checks.\u201d El Salvador\u2019s central bank president also said on state television that Bitcoin would not replace the greenback in the nation. The dollar is stable, especially when compared with Bitcoin\u2019s explosive price moves. And whereas the dollar usually fluctuates for mundane reasons, crypto can be swayed by tweets, memes and Elon Musk \u2014 not a great fit for a national or global currency. Bitcoin quadrupled last year, while the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index slipped 5.5% \u2014 a fairly big number for the greenback. Since mid-April, Bitcoin has lost nearly half of its value. Bank of America Corp. research shows Bitcoin is about four times as volatile as the Brazilian real and Turkish lira \u2014 and neither of those is anyone\u2019s model of stability. \u201cBitcoin injects extra volatility,\u201d which is counterproductive for countries looking for stability, said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. \u201cWhy do countries peg their currency to another currency or have a currency board or have a dollarized economy? It\u2019s because their currency has become too volatile or lost credence in the market and become out of control, very inflationary.\u201d Test Case That doesn\u2019t mean other countries won\u2019t look to El Salvador as a test case for what can happen, especially those that benefit from remittance flows or have central banks already researching or piloting cryptocurrencies of their own. \u201cCountries can\u2019t just look away from this option now,\u201d said Valkyrie Investments CEO Leah Wald, who previously worked for the World Bank. \u201cFor the longevity and health and well-being of Bitcoin, and the Bitcoin network, this is the dawn of a new day.\u201d Nations from Haiti to Guatemala, South Sudan and Liberia could be next to adopt Bitcoin given their dependence on remittance inflows, high poverty and low financial inclusion, according to Rahul Shah, Tellimer Ltd.\u2019s head of financials equity research. Other dollarized economies \u2014 those, like El Salvador, that are based on the greenback \u2014 are also candidates to officially adopt Bitcoin and become less dependent on the Federal Reserve and U.S. policies. \u201cIt potentially gives the ability to not be as beholden to the dollar over the long term, and be more independent of the existing financial system,\u201d said Brad Bechtel, global head of currencies at Jefferies. \u201cOnce you see one country go that way, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me to see more.\u201dEcuador, which has been dollarized for two decades, could also consider Bitcoin, said Emily Weis, a global macro strategist at State Street Corp. Colombia and Mexico, meanwhile, would risk disrupting their local currencies, even if they have large remittances and crypto interest among the local populations, she said.\u201dMany EM populations already have an affinity for cryptocurrencies given capital controls, fragile local market dynamics, and volatility of local currencies,\u201d Weis said. There\u2019s also the related business opportunities: El Salvador\u2019s Bukele, for example, is using the new law as a way to stoke interest in mining Bitcoin in the coastal country. He ordered the president of the state-owned geothermal electric company to make plans to offer greener mining facilities. \u201cAll it takes is one small domino and eventually it can create real change,\u201d said Alex Tapscott of Ninepoint Partners LP, which has a Bitcoin ETF in Canada. \u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.

If implemented, Norway could see taxes levied for the first time on electric cars from luxury automakers such as Porsche , Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz, as well as high-end Tesla and Audi models. Seeking to become the first nation to end the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2025, oil-producing Norway currently exempts all fully electric vehicles from the taxes imposed on internal combustion engines. As a result, 54% of all new cars sold in Norway last year were powered by batteries only, a global record, up from 42% in 2019 and a mere 1% a decade ago. But the policy comes at a substantial cost, estimated by the ruling center-right coalition at 19.2 billion Norwegian crowns ($2.32 billion) in lost state revenue last year, or some 250,000 crowns on average for each new electric car sold. The more expensive a car is, the bigger the sales tax and other levies foregone by the state, thus giving the biggest implied subsidies to high-income households while also raising the cost per tonne of carbon emissions saved, the paper found. \u201cNorway could improve the targeting of its tax incentives to increase their environmental impact,\u201d the paper by three IMF economists concluded. One such targeted change could be to offer subsidies to actually scrap petrol and diesel cars when replaced by EVs, the economists said, adding that Norway should also consider raising the taxes imposed on polluting cars. The proposals could resonate well with Norway\u2019s center-left opposition, which is favored to win power in national elections due in September. While supporting the goal of selling only EVs by 2025, Norway\u2019s Labour and other center-left parties all want to start imposing sales taxes on the portion of a car\u2019s cost that exceeds 600,000 crowns. For comparison, the least expensive model of an electric Porsche costs 758,000 crowns, while the top model starts at 1.7 million crowns, according to the automaker\u2019s website.

Photo Available Here While these claims go back years, Elon Musk recently tweeting that Tesla will suspend accepting Bitcoin payments because of environmental concerns brought these claims to the forefront. Excluded from these reports are the strong arguments saying these claims are unfounded. Oddly, none of the reports attempt to answer the only question that matters \u2013 how much *additional* energy was generated because of crypto mining? Instead, they treat excess energy generated by power plants and used by miners as energy created for the miners \u2013 even though that energy was already created, and would have been wasted otherwise. Unfortunately, the public was presented only one side of the story, and now many see cryptocurrency as harmful to the environment.\u00a0 But The Solar Oil Project represents a step in the right direction for energy production, helping to lower emissions and reduce environmental hazards \u2013 and it\u2019s all powered by crypto\u2026 Beyond Oil\u2122 is excited to announce the launch of a revolutionary tokenization platform \u2013 The\u00a0Solar Oil Project.\u00a0\u00a0 The technology platform aims to be the largest tokenized commodity production and exchange mechanism in the world. The platform supports local oil well operators to deploy innovative technology solutions that dramatically reduce the carbon footprint of oil production while recycling old oil wells that are abandoned or underutilized.\u00a0 This \u2018oil well recycling\u2019 program accomplishes multiple goals from an economic and environmental perspective: The Project uses the Blockchain network to distribute tokenized oil production via ERC-20 token rewards to the users. It uses one of the latest oil extraction technologies, the \u201cAir Lift Technology\u201d (ALT). The Innovation eliminates soil pollution and makes the entire process eco friendly. Photo: Solar Oil Platform is Already LIVE and Fully Functional! The Trillion Dollar Problem\u2026 In the Southern US alone, more than 100,000 Low-Volume Oil Wells are either abandoned or underutilized. These wells can quickly become an ecological hazard and cost close to a Trillion Dollars in clean up across North America. The current estimate for just the cleanup in the US state of Texas alone comes in at over $117 Billion USD.\u00a0 What SOP Intends to do differently\u2026 SOP supplies Operators and Owners with the technology and the expertise to replace the old equipment with solar-powered pumps that are economically viable, efficient, and automated. With this, the wells are given a fresh breath of life into profitable production. This is particularly effective for the well sites that are older and have minimal profit margins with traditional technologies. How the Process Works\u2026 After review by members of the Solar Oil team, selected oil well sites are equipped with eco-friendly pneumatic pumps, solar panels (where applicable), air compressors, and remote monitoring capabilities. The combination of these technologies results in a modern production mechanism that brings these abandoned wells back into active production.\u00a0 Anyone Can Participate, And Enjoy The Rewards\u2026 Perhaps the most attractive part of the project is how it encourages participation of all interested users. Anyone can create a free account on\u00a0Solar Oil\u00a0Project\u2019s website (solaroil.io) and purchase the Solar Oil Access Token (SOAX). This non speculative utility token then gives the user access to the platform where they can assign the access tokens towards the work on selected oil well sites. The revenue generated from the token sales is used to then update the wells in the selected portfolios. Because of this, the token does not meet requirements to be classified as a security, meaning US investors who typically cannot participate in the launch of new crypto-based projects are able to invest in Solar Oil. In return, users who participate in this manner receive a portion of the oil production achieved in the form of the SOPX token \u2013 The Solar Oil Production token. SOPX distribution is in proportion to how many Access tokens a user assigned to the oil portfolio. The SOPX rewards may then be traded on the Commodity Exchange for other commodities, currencies, or crypto assets.\u00a0 This elegant solution allows for equitable rewards distribution for any users that help protect the environment while resulting in profitable energy resource production. About Beyond Oil\u2122 Beyond Oil, led by Chief Strategy Officer Hitesh Juneja, aims to transition the energy sector from fossil fuels to more sustainable green energy overtime in a manner that is practical, and does not cause the economic or ecological harm that sudden and forced changes might cause.\u00a0 To make this happen in a practical manner, Beyond Oil is broken up into three phases with Phase 1, being the Solar Oil Project \u2013 a rare and revolutionary application of technology to address one of the major ecological challenges of our time while providing oil commodity backed token rewards! The goal in this phase is to attract a large number of participants through an attractive, profitable business model. On Phase 2 \u2013 The Open Commodity Exchange: The oil production from the Solar Oil Project is issued to the stakeholders in the form of the ERC-20 token \u2013 SOPX (Solar Oil Production).\u00a0 The SOPX is pegged to the global WTi spot price and is immediately liquidable through the Solar Oil Commodity exchange to a host of other assets such as Gold, Silver, Natural Gas, as well as tens of equities and cryptocurrencies. This represents the first major blockchain development allowing for open exchange between true commodity-backed crypto-assets and other fiat-based assets. \u00a0 The goal of this phase is to establish a robust financial ecosystem that new disruptive technologies can be onboarded into.\u00a0 On Phase 3 \u2013 We are focusing on Emerging Disruptive Technologies: And additional emerging technologies that do not have established profitable business models will be guided to maturity during this phase.\u00a0 For more Information about SOP, kindly get in touch via\u00a0https://solaroil.io\u00a0or\u00a0https://solaroil.io/contact-us    "}, {"source": "Financial Post", "title": "Zero, startup automating disinfecting born during pandemic raises $41.5 mln ", "url": "https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/zero-startup-automating-disinfecting-born-during-pandemic-raises-41-5-mln", "date": "Wed, 16 Jun 2021 10:02:29 GMT", "content": "San Francisco-based R-Zero, a startup formed during the pandemic to make ultraviolet disinfecting machines for commercial and institutional customers, said on Wednesday it raised $41.5 million to help automate its process and make it more efficient.

Interest in zero-emission aircraft that take off and land like helicopters but fly like planes is growing as aerospace companies look for new markets and face pressure to help decarbonize their industry though the battery-operated vehicles. Maker\u2019s debut, staged at a hangar using XR technology to simulate a ride, followed news on Thursday of two separate deals involving electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft companies based in Britain and Brazil. Archer\u2019s aircraft does not yet fly commercially but it mounted an extravagant show under a new chief creative officer who has decades of experience in experiential design and television production, Kenny Taht, to attract attention. Archer expects Maker\u2019s commercial launch in 2024 in Los Angeles and Miami and is in the process of certifying the piloted four-passenger aircraft with the Federal Aviation Administration, co-founder and co-CEO Brett Adcock told Reuters. \u201cOur real goal is to make a mass market transportation solution in and around cities,\u201d Adcock said. The taxis can fly at 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour) for distances up to 60 miles (100km) at an entry level price between $3 and $4 per passenger mile. In New York City for example, the 17-mile trip from John F. Kennedy International Airport to Manhattan would cost $50 to $70 and take around five to seven minutes versus 60 to 90 minutes in a car. While experts estimate the eVTOL market to be worth billions over the next decade, it is not expected to immediately make money and the timing of regulatory approval remains uncertain. Asked about the approval process, the FAA said: \u201cThe FAA can certify new technologies such as eVTOLs through its existing regulations. We may issue special conditions or additional requirements, depending on the type of project.\u201d As the market heats up, so has competition.

JP Morgan said the upcoming tapering process was unlikely to hurt its bullish view on equities for the second half of 2021. It expects the Fed to start tapering early next year. Back to today\u2019s agenda, investors will keep an eye on a number of ECB speakers but that comes after abundant reassurances \u2013 the latest from president Lagarde yesterday \u2013 that it\u2019s too early to even talk about withdrawing support. And in Asia Pacific, similar soundings came from Australia, where its central bank members said in the June meeting\u2019s minutes that it was too early to end the bank\u2019s bond buying program. Meantime in Japan a former Bank of Japan policymaker said the bank must eventually consider ways to unload its huge holdings of exchange-traded funds after tapering bond and ETF purchases. But the timing will be years away. On the corporate front, the U.S. and Europe are expected to announce a truce in their 17-year-old dispute over aircraft subsidies on Tuesday. That could help planemakers Boeing and Airbus and also bring relief to other industries. Good news also on the COVID-19 front. A new analysis has shown that vaccines made by Pfizer and AstraZeneca offer protection of more than 90% against hospitalization from the Delta coronavirus variant. Finally, bitcoin steadied after climbing above the $40,000 mark following remarks from Elon Musk who said Tesla may resume allowing Bitcoin transactions.

Financials dropped as JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon suggested Wall Street\u2019s pandemic-era trading boom could be drawing to a close. The Treasury 10-year yield rose to 1.50% after hitting three-month lows on Thursday amid the biggest weekly slide since December. Investors are on the lookout for signals from the Fed about a timetable for scaling back emergency monetary stimulus. Expectations are that the central bank will reaffirm the pace of bond purchases this week, even if it delivers projections for interest-rate liftoff in 2023, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The decision is due Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re in a tug-of-war between the understanding that we\u2019re having great economic growth and great earnings growth juxtaposed with the fact that we need to get our head wrapped around what inflation looks like and what it will mean both to profit margins and to the Fed,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief strategist at National Securities. With anxiety about an imminent taper fading, bond yields have fallen to the bottom of recent trading ranges, providing a green light for risk-on sentiment that may last until at least August, according to Mizuho International Plc strategists. \u201cThe overarching theme should be of an environment for investors to put cash to work,\u201d Mizuho\u2019s head of multi-asset strategy Peter Chatwell and colleagues wrote in a note to clients. \u201cWith this backdrop most asset classes should be able to at least hold ground, if not rally. We doubt any major change in Fed rhetoric will materialize before\u201d the Jackson Hole symposium in August. Oil was little changed after three weekly gains on optimism that economic reopenings will boost summer demand in the U.S. and Europe. Hedge funds boosted net-bullish positions to a nearly three-year high, according to the latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. French and German government bond peers also reversed course with yields turning higher. European equities closed mostly higher. Bitcoin continued to whipsaw investors, climbing above $40,000 after Paul Tudor Jones reiterated his support, only to erase most of its gains later. It had rose over the weekend after Elon Musk said Tesla would resume transactions with the cryptocurrency when mining it is done with more clean energy. Barry Silbert said later that the majority of cryptocurrencies are overpriced. Not just the majority, but 99% of them. Silbert is the founder and chief executive officer of Digital Currency Group, the crypto powerhouse behind the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust among other things.

With an electrification boom looming, Sandvik, whose competitors include Epiroc and Caterpillar, could sell more electric than diesel-driven underground mining kit in 10 years, its mining business head said. Although Sandvik has some 30 battery-electric loaders and trucks in underground mine production, which it says is more than any competitor, these make up less than 0.5% of its total fleet of loaders and trucks. But while the market is still limited, it is gaining pace, said Henrik Ager, head of Sandvik Mining and Rock Solutions. \u201cIn the past two years we have gone from thinking that electrification might turn into a great technology shift to becoming certain that\u2019s where we\u2019re heading,\u201d he said. Around 60% of an underground mine\u2019s energy consumption is for infrastructure, which is mainly electrified, but loaders and trucks, carrying up to 65 tonnes of rock, still run on diesel. Ager said electric machines should be fully proven to work in mines and be discussed in all procurement in 2-3 years. Investment bank UBS said electrification will bring lower emissions and savings for mining companies. \u201cIn the years to come we shall see an accelerated replacement cycle for especially underground mining equipment, although surface equipment will also benefit from solid growth rates,\u201d analyst Guillermo Peigneux Lojo said. Battery-driven machines are more expensive to buy, but savings on ventilation and cooling, big costs in underground mines, makes it beneficial to go electric already, Ager said. It could take time, however, before fully electrified mines. \u201cLet\u2019s say we start selling more electric than diesel in 10 years \u2026 before most diesel has been swapped for electricity, it\u2019s been more like 15-20 years,\u201d Ager said, adding Canada has moved farthest due to tough diesel rules. Sites which use Sandvik\u2019s battery-electric equipment include Newmont\u2019s Borden gold mine and New Gold\u2019s New Afton mine in Canada. The Swedish firm, whose equipment uses lithium-ion rechargeable batteries, expects to offer a full range of underground electric loaders and haul trucks by 2022. Sandvik, which has automation installed in some 65 mines, estimates that around 1,000 underground mines have a strong business case for automation. Ager said Sandvik\u2019s ambition is the same as U.S carmaker Tesla\u2019s \u2013 to build around the battery, rather than starting with the vehicle itself. \u201cIt\u2019s the Tesla parallel. That is what they have done, and it\u2019s much better,\u201d Ager added.

Traders will look closely at any hints from the meeting\u2019s final statement about whether and when the Fed plans to taper its bond buying program, amid concerns from some quarters about inflation as the U.S. economy bounces back from the pandemic fallout.

Wabtec, based in Pittsburgh, is developing locomotives powered by electric batteries and hydrogen fuel cells in response to rail industry demand to eliminate carbon emissions. It has a test electric locomotive model and intends to build a second generation version, with deliveries starting in 2023. \u201cThe rail industry is on the cusp of a sustainable transformation with the introduction of batteries and hydrogen to power locomotive fleets,\u201d Wabtec Chief Executive Rafael Santana said in a statement. Under the nonbinding memorandum of understanding, GM will supply Ultium electric batteries and Hydrotec hydrogen fuel cell power cubes. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. \u201cWabtec\u2019s decision to deploy GM\u2019s Ultium battery and Hydrotec hydrogen fuel cell systems further validates our advanced technology,\u201d GM President Mark Reuss said. Ultium is a key part of GM\u2019s strategy to roll out efficient and cost effective electric vehicles, and closing a deal with Wabtec would help spread development costs over a larger volume of batteries. GM is developing a hydrogen fuel-cell-powered commercial truck with truck maker Navistar. GM\u2019s Ultium batteries will be built by the company\u2019s joint venture with South Korea battery maker LG Energy Solution , which is building plants in Ohio and Tennessee. The hydrogen fuel-cell systems will be assembled by GM\u2019s joint venture with Honda in Brownstown, Michigan. Last month, Wabtec announced that its FLXdrive all-electric locomotive, during a test program with BNSF Railway in California, delivered more than an 11% average reduction in fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions for the entire train \u2013 the equivalent of over 6,200 gallons of diesel fuel saved and about 69 tons of CO2 emissions reduced. It is also developing hydrogen fuel-cell-powered locomotives. The 430,000-pound electric locomotive, with a battery capacity of 2.4 megawatt hours (MWh), uses 18,000 lithium-ion battery cells, Wabtec\u2019s chief technology officer, Eric Gebhardt, said in a recent interview. It generates its energy largely through regenerative braking. The company intends to build a second-generation electric locomotive with a battery capacity of more than 6 MWh, a level it says can reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions by up to 30%. Gebhardt compared that capacity to 100 Tesla vehicles. Wabtec expects to begin shipments of the second-generation electric locomotive in mid-2023, he said.

For Stellantis NV, that is the smell of money. For the City of Detroit, it means nearly 5,000 jobs. Stellantis opened the doors of its new $1.6 billion Mack Avenue assembly complex on Thursday, showing off parts of a 3 million square foot complex completed and launched into production largely during the pandemic. The Grand Cherokee L vehicles on the assembly line are the first of a new generation of Jeep\u2019s best-selling model line, aimed at expanding the brand\u2019s sales to customers who want an SUV with three rows of seats. Until now, Grand Cherokees only offered seating for five. Now, with room for as many as seven passengers, Jeep can take on rivals such as Ford Motor Co\u2019s Explorer, General Motors Co\u2019s GMC Acadia and larger SUVs from European and Japanese brands. The plant, which began building vehicles in March, now is operating three shifts a day, plant manager Michael Brieda said. In a tight labor market, Brieda said the biggest challenge the plant had \u201cwas finding people capable of working in a manufacturing environment.\u201d Job applicants were given dexterity tests as part of their interviews, he said. About 2,100 Detroit City residents have been hired at the plant, the company said. The new Jeep plant underscores the split personality of the United States vehicle market, where most of the vehicles coming down the Mack assembly line will be sold. Tesla Inc is the industry\u2019s most valuable automaker thanks to its lead in electric vehicle technology. But for Detroit\u2019s automakers, demand for pickup trucks and decked-out gasoline-fueled SUVs still pays the bills. As the Mack assembly complex accelerates, Stellantis will have two adjacent factories in Detroit capable of building 500,000 or more Grand Cherokee models a year. The nearby Jefferson North Jeep plant was built in 1991 \u2013 and until now was the Motor City\u2019s newest assembly plant. Mario Holmes, the manager who oversaw the development of the Grand Cherokee L, said much effort went into designing a new, more efficient architecture that uses aluminum and high-strength steel to cut weight. Though the new model has three rows of seats, it\u2019s in the same weight class as five-passenger SUVs, he said. There will be an electrified powertrain offered, but details on that will come later, he said. One sign of the importance of the Grand Cherokee L is that Brieda, the plant manager, said he has had no problems getting enough semiconductors for the new model, even as Stellantis is idling assembly lines for other vehicles amid a global shortage of the chips needed for modern motoring systems.

CEO Elon Musk cited it as a reason to stop accepting Bitcoin as payment for the company\u2019s cars. Musk later expressed support for the group. Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday blasted the energy use while chairing a Senate Banking subcommittee hearing that explored issues with existing cryptocurrencies as well as whether the U.S. Federal Reserve should issue its own.

Nine companies, including MicroStrategy, Galaxy Digital and Darin Feinstein\u2019s Blockcap, are listed as founding members. Crypto miners use vast sums of computing power and energy to verify transactions on the blockchain. Their energy use is comparable to that of many developed countries and rivals the emissions from major fossil-fuel users and producers such as airlines and oil-services firms, according to an analysis by Bank of America Corp., though others dispute that, arguing it\u2019s no worse than the carbon footprint of cars, power plants and factories. Saylor had convened the first informal meeting of some of the miners in May. Musk has no formal role in the group. Miners agreed to form the council \u201cto standardize energy reporting,\u201d Saylor said.

Among its findings, the investigators\u2019 report said the trade ministry \u201ceffectively asked\u201d a government adviser, described as \u201cMr. M,\u201d to negotiate with Harvard University\u2019s endowment fund to change its voting behavior. \u201cMinistry officials have informed me that it\u2019s not true that any request was made to engage with individual investors,\u201d Trade Minister Hiroshi Kajiyama told a regular press briefing. He added that the ministry was waiting on Toshiba\u2019s response to the report. Sources have previously told Reuters that Hiromichi Mizuno, a ministry adviser at the time, had told the Harvard fund it could be subject to a regulatory probe if the fund did not follow management\u2019s recommendations at last year\u2019s annual general meeting. Mizuno, a Tesla Inc board member and friend of Elon Musk, previously oversaw Japan\u2019s $1.4 trillion Government Pension Investment Fund and is currently the United Nations Special Envoy on Innovative Finance and Sustainable Investment. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The independent investigation found that Toshiba had devised a plan to effectively prevent shareholders from exercising their rights by putting undue influence on Effissimo Capital Management, Toshiba\u2019s top shareholder, to withdraw its proposed board nominees. The report also said the plan sought to pressure another fund, 3D Investment Partners, in addition to the Harvard fund to change their votes and that Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga verbally encouraged pressure on shareholders when he was chief cabinet secretary during a meeting with a senior Toshiba executive last year. Suga, who left Japan yesterday for a meeting of G7 leaders in Britain, has denied that allegation. The report flies in the face of efforts led by Japan\u2019s finance ministry to improve corporate governance and attract foreign investment, and comes as the country tries to burnish its international reputation ahead of the 2020 Olympic games in Tokyo next month. As one of the industrial conglomerates that modernized Japan and helped its post World War Two economic recovery, Toshiba enjoys close ties with government. Its nuclear reactors and defense equipment businesses mean it is also closely monitored by industry bureaucrats. In 2017, however, battered by accounting scandals and massive writedowns on its U.S. nuclear reactor business, Toshiba had to quickly seek a large capital injection from overseas investors. As a result, activist investors are estimated to account for 25% of Toshiba\u2019s shareholder base. Toshiba\u2019s shares were down 1.3% in early afternoon trade while the Nikkei 225 index was flat.

Instead of plugging in, the driver pulled into a swapping station near Mission Bay, where a set of robot arms lifted the car off of the ground,\u00a0unloaded the depleted batteries\u00a0and\u00a0replaced them with a fully charged set.\u00a0Twelve minutes later the Leaf pulled away with 32 kilowatt hours of energy, enough to drive about 130 miles, for a cost of $13. A swap like this is a rare event in the U.S. The Leaf\u2019s replaceable battery is made by Ample, one of the only companies offering a service that\u2019s more popular in markets in Asia. In March, Ample announced that it had deployed five stations around the Bay Area. Nearly 100 Uber drivers are using them, the company says, making an average of 1.3 swaps per day. Ample\u2019s operation is tiny compared to the 100,000 public EV chargers in the U.S.\u2013not to mention the 150,000 gas stations running more than a million nozzles. Yet Ample\u2019s founders Khaled Hassounah and John de Souza are convinced that it\u2019s only a matter of time before the U.S. discovers that swapping is a necessary part of the transition to electric vehicles. China, which is home to roughly half of the\u00a07 million passenger EVs on the road as of last year, has more than 600 swapping stations and is on pace to have 1,000 by year\u2019s end, according to a\u00a0tally by clean-energy research group BloombergNEF. \u201cThey\u2019ve already made the determination that swapping has to be a significant part of the solution,\u201d says Hassounah, \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough deployment yet to realize that we need this in the U.S.\u201d Even in China, however, where the\u00a0swapping industry dwarfs that of the U.S., the technology is still only a small\u00a0piece of the\u00a0charging infrastructure. In the U.S. most investment so far has gone into building faster plug-in stations and batteries that can accept power quickly without overheating. President Biden has proposed a target of 500,000 public chargers by 2030. His plan, which calls for scaling and improving fast-charging networks, makes no mention of battery swapping. Yet plug-in chargers come with limits that can\u2019t be overcome simply by adding more. They are a burden on the power grid, expensive to build, and, even at their fastest, agonizingly slow compared to gas pumps. Hassounah and De Souza founded Ample in 2014 and have raised about $70 million to date from investors including the venture arms of oil and gas giants Royal Dutch Shell plc and Repsol SA. They\u2019ve spent the last seven years studying\u00a0how to swap batteries in a cheap, vehicle-agnostic way and\u00a0believe they\u2019ve finally\u00a0cracked it. For now they are\u00a0focusing on ride-hailing fleets, as professional drivers\u00a0have the most need for fast charging. Late last year, Ample entered a partnership with Uber to help coordinate with the the fleet management services that provide drivers with cars, insurance, and other services. On June 10, Ample announced a separate partnership with the fleet management service Sally, which specializes in making EVs available to ride-hailing and delivery drivers. The two plan to work to together to deploy EVs\u00a0and\u00a0swapping stations in San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. Sally aims\u00a0to have hundreds of Ample-ready\u00a0Kia Niro EVs running in the Bay Area by the end of this\u00a0summer and to begin offering swapping to drivers in New York by the fall. Sally co-founders Nicholas Williams and Adriel Gonzalez say\u00a0the company chose to work with\u00a0Ample because\u00a0plug-in\u00a0fast-charging options degrade batteries, come with high energy costs during peak use, and\u00a0are\u00a0too\u00a0slow. \u201cWe had a supercharging\u00a0concept that would probably do it in 30 minutes, but that was really too long for us,\u201d says Williams.\u00a0 Drivers in San Francisco rent Ample-ready EVs\u00a0from\u00a0fleet management services,\u00a0just as they would for a combustion engine car, and pay the fleet manager for their swaps at the end of each week. The fleets then pay Ample by the mile for the energy, with no upfront fees for installing stations. The energy cost for fleets, according to Ample, is typically 10 to 20 percent cheaper than gas. \u00a0\u201cAll the drivers that have used it have come over from gas vehicles,\u201d says De Souza.\u00a0\u201cThis is the first time they\u2019re driving an electric vehicle.\u201d Most EV charging in the U.S. happens at private chargers in driveways and garages, where drivers can use vehicle downtime to refill batteries slowly. But convincing Americans to ditch combustions engines and go electric means competing with the convenience of gas stations. The average fill-up, according to the NACS, a trade group for convenience stores and gas stations, takes 4.5 minutes, including the time it takes to pay. With a typical fill-up of about 12 gallons, a car that gets 25 miles per gallon can add 300 miles of range in less than five minutes. Doing the same in 40 minutes counts as ultra-fast for an electric charger. Ten such chargers on the side of a highway would need at least a megawatt connection, enough to power hundreds of homes. Swapping, at least in theory, offers an elegant solution to the problem of re-charging EVs quickly without taxing the grid. Where an ultra-fast charger acts as a firehose, delivering a rush of energy on demand, Ample\u2019s system works like a garden hose, constantly filling small buckets\u00a0 and handing them over a few at a time. So far, however, attempts at swapping in the U.S. have come to nothing. Tesla experimented with the technology in 2013 but soon abandoned it, opting instead to build its network of \u201cSuperchargers.\u201d The startup Better Place, which planned to sell swappable batteries in its EVs, went bankrupt that same year, after raising nearly $1 billion.\u00a0 There are two basic reasons that the electric vehicle industry in the U.S. has so far opted to plug-in rather than swap out. The first is weight. Batteries are heavy. Every mile of range adds a few pounds to the weigh of an EV battery, so a car with 250 miles of range might be carrying a a pack that weighs as much 1,000 pounds. Replacing a pack of that size is not as simple as swapping out a few D cells from a flashlight. Building a station\u00a0that can handle these loads, says De Souza, typically costs around $1 million. Ample tackles the weight problem by breaking the battery pack into pieces. The company uses a modular system of lithium-ion packs, each about the size of shoe box, and arranges them on trays. Each module holds about three kilowatt hours of power and weighs around 30 lb. Most cars take 16 to 32 modules, depending on the size and desired range. The modules are stacked on trays four or five at a time, with a typical car holding three to five trays. The robotic arms in Ample\u2019s stations move the trays one at a time so that they never have to carry more than about 150 pounds. The average swap takes ten minutes. Ample\u2019s goal is to get it down to five minutes by the end of this year. Each stations holds about ten car\u2019s worth of batteries, all steadily re-charging as cars come and go. This allows them to deliver energy at a rate between 500 kilowatts and 1.5 megawatts per hour with a connection of only 60 to 100 kilowatts. Ample says it can build and deploy one of its swapping stations in a footprint the size of two parking spots for tens of thousands of dollars. No digging is required because power can be taken from an overhang connection. \u201cGive us six weeks. We can set up a whole city,\u201d says Hassounah. If Ample can deliver on this promise, it would undercut not only the existing swapping options, but most fast chargers as well. According to a BloombergNEF survey last year, installation costs for ultra-fast chargers, which require digging in the ground, ranged from $111,000 to $333,000 per megawatt, with hardware starting at about $30,000 per connector and running as high as $125,000. While dealing with heavy batteries is a chore, the biggest challenge for swapping is getting automakers to change the way they build EVs. \u201cCompatibility is a massive problem,\u201d says Ryan Fisher, an analyst for electrified transport at BloombergNEF. \u201cWhen you talk about doing it across multiple manufacturers, that becomes pretty complicated quite quickly.\u201d Plus, there are other ways of smoothing the peaks and valleys in energy demand that don\u2019t require making alterations to EVs already on the road. The startup Freewire, for instance, stores power in batteries inside of its chargers, allowing them to sip power from the grid and deliver to cars quickly.\u00a0 When Tesla flirted with swapping, it built a proprietary system with its own swappable packs. Swapping stations in China have largely followed the same model, with carmakers building their own networks. NIO, the industry leader, has done more than\u00a02 million swaps at 192 stations. BloombergNEF analysis shows that NIO\u2019s stations are exceptionally efficient at delivering power, with an average of 1,543 kilowatt hours per day per station\u201333 times the rate of China\u2019s average public\u00a0plug-in connectors. But building multiple proprietary swapping networks in the U.S. makes little sense. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like every car company has to build their own gas stations all around the country,\u201d says De Souza. And creating a standard battery pack for every EV is also a non-starter. Automakers are not about to forfeit control over the most expensive part of an electric vehicle and one of the main ways they differentiate themselves from the competition. Instead of asking automakers to adapt, Ample has created a flexible system that adapts to automakers.\u201dWe\u2019ve built an adapter plate that has the same shape as the original battery,\u201d says Hassounah. \u201cSo for one vehicle, it\u2019s a one adapter plate, for another, it\u2019s a slightly different plate.\u201d Each plate is designed to interface\u00a0with the car in exactly the same way as the original battery, with the same bolts, the same electrical connection, and same software\u2013and\u00a0meeting\u00a0the same safety standards. The plate, which holds the battery trays, never leaves the car. \u201cYou just put this thing in and it works,\u201d says Hassounah, \u201ckind of like replacing a tire.\u201d Ample says it is working with five manufacturers and has so far built plates for ten models. Non-disclosure agreements prohibit them from saying which automakers, but models seen in their promotional materials\u00a0include the Nissan Leaf, Kia Niro and Mercedes-Benz EQC. The idea is for automakers to be able to offer swappable battery packs as an option in their EVs. The biggest hurdle at the moment is getting the car companies, who already struggling with supply chain disruptions, to integrate Ample into their manufacturing. For now, Sally and Ample plan to retrofit Kia Niro\u2019s with swappable battery packs. The hope is that if Sally and other fleet managers say they\u00a0want\u00a0to place orders for hundreds of thousands of Ample-ready cars, that will help push manufacturers to build them.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s very much in the\u00a0early stages of the industry,\u201d says Fisher. \u201cSo the proof is in the pudding.\u201d \u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.

Now, he\u2019s taking his message to the heart of Wall Street. Prince Abdulaziz is scheduled to speak June 16 at the Robin Hood Investors Conference, a red-carpet event that brings together luminaries of the U.S. hedge-fund industry such as Paul Tudor Jones, Ray Dalio and Stanley Druckenmiller, and rising stars like Cathie Wood. The Saudi oil minister has battled to keep short-sellers at bay for more than a year, famously warning speculators in September not to bet against him, and more recently lambasting the view that the world should stop investing in oil to protect the climate. \u201cI want the guys in the trading floors to be as jumpy as possible,\u201d he said after an OPEC+ meeting on Sept. 17. \u201cI\u2019m going to make sure whoever gambles on this market will be ouching like hell.\u201d While previous Saudi ministers have spoken in private with commodity hedge funds, the Robin Hood conference \u2014 which is held behind closed doors \u2014 raises the relationship to a higher level. The event has seen numerous investment trends gain traction \u2014 and in recent years, many of those ideas ran contrary to the interests of Saudi Arabia. In 2019, for example, investors debated climate change at length, discussing \u201cwhy energy and transportation will be obsolete by 2030.\u201d And a year earlier, electric-car manufacturer Tesla Inc. was the center of attention. La La Land For Prince Abdulaziz, the conference will be an opportunity to talk about long-term trends in energy, just weeks after the International Energy Agency published its controversial road map to slash emissions, urging an end to new oil and gas investments. The kingdom dismissed the report, calling it a sequel to \u201cLa La Land\u201d \u2014 the 2016 romantic comedy movie whose lead characters break out into song-and-dance numbers. \u201cWhy should I take it seriously?\u201d the prince said when asked about the road map at an OPEC+ press briefing earlier this month. Rather than stop investing, Riyadh actually plans to increase the production capacity of its state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco, to 13 million barrels a day from 12 million, and the minister hinted that it could go even higher. The 2021 edition of the Robin Hood conference will also bring other raw materials under the spotlight. For the first time in at least five years, the gathering features a panel on commodity investment, a sign that rising prices for everything from lumber to coal have attracted the attention of Wall Street. \u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.

It\u2019s an unexpected priority. Nickel isn\u2019t on the U.S. list of critical minerals. Although the country depends on imports, 68% of supplies come from what the report calls \u201callied nations\u201d such as Canada, Australia, Norway and Finland. But the Department of Energy (DOE) has identified Class 1 nickel, the type best suited to lithium-ion batteries, as both key vulnerability and key opportunity. The emphasis on nickel doesn\u2019t mean the White House is complacent about other critical battery materials such as lithium and cobalt but it says a lot about how the administration is thinking about the problem. LOW RESERVES, NO PROCESSING The United States is import-dependent across the spectrum of battery metals with large parts of the supply chain captured by China, a problematic international trading partner. However, the nature of the dependency differs by mineral, starting in the ground. The United States, for example, \u201chas lithium resources and domestic corporations well-versed in recovery and refinement globally,\u201d according to the report. The ambition, therefore, is to stimulate more domestic mining and, even more importantly, domestic processing through a potential mix of purchasing guarantees, federal funding and research and development into enhanced recovery technology. China\u2019s investment in this section of the supply chain \u201chas made them the world\u2019s leader despite limited domestic lithium supply,\u201d the report notes. When it comes to nickel, however, the only active U.S. mine \u2013 Eagle in Michigan \u2013 is due to retire in 2025 and domestic deposits are small and low grade. There is no domestic nickel processing capacity outside a limited amount of by-product salt production. Yet this particular battery metal is the one likely to experience the most significant demand increase over the coming years, the report says, with \u201cmarket indications that there could be a large shortage of Class 1 nickel in the next 3-7 years.\u201d Indeed, with nickel content rising in battery cathode design, not having enough of the right kind of nickel \u201cposes a supply chain risk for battery manufacturing globally, not just in the United States.\u201d RE-DESIGNING DEMAND Nickel demand is rising because automakers are trying to reduce their usage of cobalt, a metal that is overshadowed by a supply-chain reliance on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and its artisanal workforce. The Department of Energy wants to help them with a commitment to \u201ca multi-year initiative to address the scientific and engineering issues with reducing and eliminating the cobalt in EV batteries.\u201d Research is already taking place into new materials such as silicon and lithium metal anodes with progress to date \u201cvery good,\u201d the report says. The motivation is the same as that of Tesla or Volkswagen. Changing the demand dynamic is the surest long-term way of resolving cobalt\u2019s cost and supply problems. The DOE awarded cobalt the \u201clowest \u2018quality\u2019 supply chain score of all elements, largely due to the alleged mining conditions in the Democratic Republic of Congo and conditions surrounding cobalt refining in China.\u201d But with most of the world\u2019s known cobalt reserves in the Congo, there\u2019s an acceptance that short-term risks can only be partly mitigated through a combination of maximizing domestic resources, particularly old tailings, and working with allied countries. The report recommends using the U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to \u201cidentify projects in allied and partner nations that can be funded to create new sustainable mining and processing operations for lithium, graphite, and other key metals and materials.\u201d RECYCLING Also critical to reducing critical minerals dependence will be building recycling capacity, according to the DOE. Battery recycling could meet up to 30% of nickel and 80% of cobalt usage in electric vehicles by the end of the decade but there are multiple hurdles in getting there. It will require a national recycling policy to align a sector that is currently fragmented by state legislation. Without one batteries will go to landfill or be exported to other countries where the metals will be extracted. It will also need more research and development on how to recycle electric vehicle batteries because it\u2019s currently unprofitable in many cases and is becoming more chemically difficult as battery ingredients multiply. Ideally, it should take place in tandem with a build-out of other parts of the battery supply chain such as cell and pack manufacture, allowing \u201cnew\u201d scrap to be continuously looped back into the production process. The report recommends the United States should form a cross-agency task force to \u201ccapture a holistic view of the opportunity landscape and to coordinate action to support domestic recycling.\u201d Despite the long list of challenges, the DOE concludes that recycled material can \u201cbuffer volume and price instabilities\u201d in the short term and, as ever more EV batteries reach end-of-life, \u201ccould eventually supply a significant share of critical battery material needs.\u201d NICKEL URGENCY Recycling will likely help close the U.S. dependency gap faster in cobalt than it will in nickel. This is because the current recyclables stream is largely made up of consumer electronics and first-generation EVs, neither of which contain much nickel. The world is going to need a lot more new nickel before recycling can make a real impact. There is a nickel mining and processing boom underway in Indonesia but rather than offering any comfort to the United States, the dominance of Chinese players simply means the country risks \u201cfalling further behind China in this critical mineral.\u201d As such, \u201cthere is urgency to developing a strategy around Class 1 nickel,\u201d the report concludes. Starting with a U.S.-funded nickel processing plant.

In addition, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other key Democrats to discuss EVs and vehicle emissions, the sources said. GM TRUCKS LOSING ANOTHER FUEL ECONOMY FEATURE DUE TO CHIP SHORTAGE Barra will also meet U.S. Representative Richard Neal, head of the tax policy Ways and Means Committee, Frank Pallone, who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee, and two key Michigan Democrats: Representatives Dan Kildee and Debbie Dingell, the sources said. WOOING WASHINGTON Working with Washington is critical as President Joe Biden has proposed $174 billion to boost EVs and charging as part of his infrastructure plan, including $100 billion in new EV rebates. GM's ability to benefit from the current $7,500 federal EV tax credit has expired. GM has sparred with Democrats over vehicle emissions rules, but last week said it supported overall emissions reductions in California's 2019 deal with other major automakers. It has also sought more flexibility to hit carbon reduction target between now and 2026. GM OPTIMISTIC IN FULL YEAR EARNINGS, EVEN WITH CHIP SHORTAGE The Associated Press reported on Monday that GM planned to announce two new U.S. battery plants, citing comments by President Mark Reuss. GM confirmed the executive's comments, but sources said the company has not decided where in the United States to build the plants, which are each expected to cost more than $2 billion. In January, GM said it was setting a goal to sell all its new cars, SUVs and light pickup trucks with zero tailpipe emissions by 2035, a dramatic shift away from gasoline and diesel engines. GM and its South Korean joint-venture partner, LG Energy Solution, are already building a battery plant in northeastern Ohio and have announced a second, $2.3 billion battery plant will be located in Spring Hill, Tennessee. GM confirmed in November it would speed up the rollout of new EVs, with plans to offer 30 models globally by 2025, up from a prior target of 20 by 2023. Barra said the automaker wants to exceed annual sales of 1 million EVs in the United States and China by 2025. On May 26, a Senate committee advanced legislation that would boost tax credits to as much as $12,500 for EVs assembled by union workers in the United States. The current maximum tax credit is $7,500. The bill also includes a 30% tax credit for manufacturers to retool or build new facilities to produce advanced energy technologies including batteries. That would represent a big boost to GM's battery factory plans.

Deliveries aren't scheduled to begin until the spring of 2022.\u00a0 The full-size truck has a starting price of $39,974 (not including delivery fees) and qualifies for the full $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit. A fully-loaded Platinum trim luxury version is currently listed at an estimated price of $90,474. 2022 Ford F-150 Lightning (Ford) The F-150 Lightning comes standard with all-wheel drive and a range of 230 miles per charge, while an extended-range version with a 300-mile rating will also be available. The 300-mile model is also the most powerful F-150 ever and can accelerate to 60 mph in roughly four and a half seconds, which puts it on par with the dual-motor Tesla Cybertruck that's scheduled to be on sale just before the F-150 Lightning. The latest pre-order figures for F-150 Lightning come in behind the Ford Bronco, which received about 200,000 reservations, according to a company spokesperson.\u00a0 Tesla claimed to have received 250,000 reservations for the Cybertruck in the five days following its eventful reveal in November 2019, when its designer shattered its alleged bulletproof windows with a small metal ball. An ongoing, unofficial crowdsourced tally managed by Tesla fans estimated that over one million people have put down a $100 refundable deposit for the Cybertruck as of the end of last month. Musk estimates output at the Cybertruck's Texas factory will be 250,000 to 300,000 annually. In comparison, CEO Jim Farley said that the F-150 Lightning had racked up 44,500 reservations less than 48 hours after its unveiling. The F-150 Lightning will be produced at the company's Rogue Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan.\u00a0 Ford reported a 184% surge in electric vehicle sales in May. More than 10,300 electrified vehicles were sold last month, with the F-150 PowerBoost and Escape providing the largest boost, the automaker said. The Escape alone saw a 125% growth in electrified sales over the past year and a 132% increase in hybrid sales from a year ago. Meanwhile, vehicle sales of Ford's all-electric Mustang Mach-E totaled 1,945. The automaker delivered 1,951 in April. However, the company continues to feel the pain from an ongoing semiconductor chip shortage and recently announced plans to cut production and temporarily shut some plants.

Some investors are wagering that Wall Street's preference for green energy will depress spending on oil extraction, setting the stage for supply shortages and higher fuel prices. The bets come as money managers line up trillions of dollars for wind, solar and other renewable programs and expenditures on oil projects tumble. The drop in fossil-fuel spending is becoming so severe that energy companies could struggle to quench the world's thirst for oil, some analysts say. Crude is still expected to remain in high demand over the next decade to make transportation fuels and petrochemicals used for plastics and other household products. U.S. consumption has surged lately following the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, and output cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have given prices a further boost. U.S. crude recently hit $70 a barrel, its highest level in more than 2 1/2 years, and has roughly doubled since the end of October. Some traders are using options, which allow the holder to buy or sell an asset at a specific price in the future, to wager on prices hitting $100 by the end of next year. Even after OPEC and its allies lift output in the months ahead, some analysts think production will struggle to catch up to demand, which the International Energy Agency projects will rise at least through 2026. Spending on oil extraction fell last year to about $330 billion, less than half the total from its 2014 record, according to research firm Wood Mackenzie. That figure is expected to rise just modestly this year and in the years ahead. Leigh Goehring, managing partner at commodities-focused investment firm Goehring & Rozencwajg Associates, said he thinks prices will soar in coming years as consumption tops production capacity for a sustained period for the first time ever. His firm lifted its investments in energy producers during last year's crash and has maintained those holdings. \"This is the basis for the next oil crisis,\" he said. \"We're in uncharted territory.\" View of the pumpjack in the oil well of the oil field. The arrangement is commonly used for onshore wells producing little oil. Pumpjacks are common in oil-rich areas. Analysts say an oil-price surge could happen like this: As more people resume travel following the pandemic, demand is expected to rise. That would allow OPEC to ease supply restrictions and lower global inventories of crude. If consumption continues climbing beyond 2022 as many expect, the world would then need more oil from the same companies currently being told by investors to limit spending, resulting in a supply shortfall. OPEC has the ability to quickly increase production, and there are currently ample reserves that could be tapped to respond to price spikes. But many on Wall Street are retreating from the fossil-fuel industry, leaving investors questioning whether companies would be able to raise enough money to fill any longer-term supply gaps. In recent years, growing output from U.S. shale producers and giant oil companies suppressed prices. Now, many analysts doubt that these companies will rapidly beef up spending in the face of industry consolidation and mounting environmental pressure. Energy firms have recently slashed the value of their assets by tens of billions of dollars as the sector copes with last year's wave of bankruptcies and project setbacks. Planned investment in oil supply globally falls about $600 billion short of what will be needed to meet projected demand by 2030, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Christyan Malek. Pressure to deliver cash to shareholders, partly driven by worries about the long-run outlook for oil demand, has limited the industry's ability to plow money into new projects, he said. \"It's just hard to see where the capital is going to come from to grow at a rate that will be needed from 2022,\" said David Meaney, founding principal of Assert Capital Management LP. The Dallas-based hedge fund is positioning for higher oil prices through futures and options. The wagers are a reminder that the unprecedented transition to renewables and electric vehicles is still in its early stages and could go through several phases. It also shows the challenges facing producers like Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC. In addition to concerns about spending and shareholder returns, they are contending with mandates to limit environmental damage. Shell said last week that it would accelerate efforts to cut emissions following a Dutch court ruling ordering the company to take more drastic action. As the economy recovers from the pandemic, the question confronting the energy industry is whether demand will eventually fall to match limited supplies, investors say. That reverses a decadeslong paradigm of wondering if production can catch up to consumption, with Wall Street debating uncertain estimates about the speed of the renewable transition. \"I'm bullish on electric vehicles. It still takes time before they can take a meaningful chunk out of oil demand,\" said Jason Bordoff, a former Obama administration energy adviser and the founding director of Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy. A wind turbine farm owned by PacifiCorp near Glenrock, Wyo. (AP Photo/Matt Young, File) (AP) Another obstacle for producers: declining output from existing wells over time. The number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. remains about 60% below levels from the end of 2018 even as prices have surged, figures from Baker Hughes show. \"Investors have made it clear to the energy sector: 'Don't spend a lot of money,'\" said Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at energy asset manager Tortoise. \"Boards and management teams have to listen to the shareholders.\" The energy industry isn't alone in its cautious approach. Miners, which burned through cash the last time industrial metals prices shot higher, have also been reluctant to drive money into projects because investors have encouraged greater discipline. Some analysts argue that concerns about a dearth of oil are overstated, particularly when large suppliers are still intentionally withholding copious amounts due to coronavirus disruptions. Producers and investors might be less disciplined in limiting capital spending and supply if prices surge and they could profit, they say. But for now, many are positioning for shortages. Hayal Ahmadzada, chief trading officer at the trading arm of Azerbaijan's national oil company, drives a Tesla Inc. electric car but expects crude to rise above $100 a barrel next year. \"The transition has to be very careful to avoid the big disruptions,\" he said.

In under two decades, this electric vehicle (EV) maker has disrupted a 130-year-old industry. Not surprisingly, shares of Tesla are up 860%. But even after those gains, Tesla stock could still crush the market over the next decade. Here's why. On several occasions, CEO Elon Musk has mentioned manufacturing\u00a0as Tesla's long-term advantage. That may be surprising, but the company has made great strides in its pursuit of efficiency. Image source: Tesla. In 2017, Tesla introduced the 2170 battery cell, boosting energy capacity by 50%. The company started producing the new cell at the Gigafactory in Nevada, and by mid-2018, that factory was the highest-volume battery plant in the world. In 2019, Tesla completed\u00a0construction of Gigafactory Shanghai in just 10 months, expanding total capacity and localizing its China business. That cut costs by reducing the number of cars shipped across the ocean on boats. In 2020, Tesla broke ground on new Gigafactories in Berlin and Texas, and expects to deliver vehicles from both plants in 2021. Similar to China, this will drive efficiency by expanding capacity and localizing its European business. Notably, even without a factory in Europe, the Model 3 was still the best-selling premium sedan worldwide in Q1 2021. Put another way, with just two factories, Tesla delivered enough vehicles to surpass the BMW 3 Series and the Mercedes E-Class. Here's the big picture: Since 2017, Tesla's pursuit of efficiency has paid off in a big way. Its average cost per vehicle dropped 55% ($84,000 to $38,000) and Tesla achieved an industry-leading operating margin of 6.3% in 2020. Currently, even the highest estimates put Tesla's battery costs\u00a0at $187 per kilowatt-hour\u00a0(kWh) -- that's 10% cheaper than the next closest competitor, and 24% cheaper than the industry average. To add, Tesla also sells the only\u00a0EV that exceeds 400 miles in range. In other words, Tesla's batteries cost less and they go farther. Image source: Tesla. In 2020, Tesla introduced another game changer: the 4680 battery cell. Built with an innovative tabless design, this new cell is expected to cut battery costs by 56%, widening Tesla's lead over the industry. Management also believes the 4680 will boost range by 54% and reduce capital expenditures by 69%. That last figure is particularly noteworthy, as it makes this technology highly scalable. In other words, Tesla will spend less on plants and equipment (on a relative basis), but it will produce batteries with a greater range at a lower cost. Tying everything together, Musk believes these efficiencies will allow Tesla to build a $25,000 car within three years. Theoretically, no competitor will be able to match that price, which should help Tesla take market share. Tesla is a frontrunner in the race to build an autonomous vehicle. Its autopilot and full self-driving platforms already offer some automation, but they also serve another purpose: crowdsourcing data. Tesla has over 1 million vehicles on the road, all with external cameras to capture video. As a result, the company had collected 3 billion\u00a0miles of autopilot data by February 2020. By comparison, Alphabet's Waymo -- the first and only company to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service -- had just 20 million\u00a0real-world miles at the time. Image source: Getty Images. That's a big deal. Data is the foundation of artificial intelligence, and Tesla has a significant advantage. To further that edge, it's also building Dojo. This is a supercomputer designed to train the deep neural networks (i.e. AI engines) that will make Tesla's cars autonomous. Notably, Musk believes Dojo\u00a0will be an  order of magnitude  more efficient\u00a0than the next best solution. Here's the big picture: Research from Ark Invest suggests that autonomous ride-hailing platforms could earn $1.2 trillion\u00a0in annual operating profits by 2030. Cathie Wood's team also believes autonomous EV makers will earn $250 billion each year. Tesla falls into both categories, as it plans to launch a ride-hailing network in the future. If Ark is right, Tesla's many advantages -- manufacturing, innovation, and autonomous technology -- should help it capture a good portion of a $1.45 trillion market opportunity. That's why, despite an outrageous valuation of 600 times earnings, I think Tesla could still crush the market.

Historically, Musk has made some bold claims online, and not all of his ideas have come to fruition. For this reason, it made headlines when Tesla actually filed for trademarks in the restaurant services industry -- over three years later. \u00a0Despite the hype, if Tesla goes through with a restaurant in its Supercharger network, investors need to carefully consider whether it is a worthwhile investment of capital and management energy. Image source: Tesla. Tesla's Supercharger network consists of 908 Supercharger stations \u00a0across the country, each with varying numbers of individual Superchargers. The problem is that charging a Tesla takes time, and the company wants to provide Tesla drivers with entertainment while they wait to hit the road again. However, doing some digging on Tesla's Supercharger map reveals some insight into this problem. In the U.S., not a single Supercharger can be found beyond a short walking distance to a restaurant, coffee shop, grocery store, or service plaza. Tesla has located most Supercharger stations near several of these establishments, and some even have direct access to shopping centers. \u00a0 With Supercharger stations already providing Tesla drivers with options for spending their downtime, the Supercharger network does not translate to a surefire captive market for Tesla. However, Elon is set on bringing retro-style entertainment to the Supercharger network in hopes that it will nonetheless drive revenue and attract new customers. Before addressing this question, it's important to understand all the charging options that Tesla drivers have. Supercharger stations, destination chargers, and at-home chargers all have different use cases, pros, and cons. Supercharger stations are located in most major cities and along popular travel routes for high-speed charging during long-distance drives. \u00a0A standard Tesla Model 3 can charge to full capacity in under an hour at a Supercharger. Charging fees can vary based on location, charge volume, and seasonality but generally run around 28 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh). \u00a0 Destination chargers are installed by Tesla's 'Charging Partners'\u00a0-- usually shopping centers, hotels, movie theaters, or restaurants -- and allow patrons of those businesses to charge for free. A destination charger's speed is significantly lower than a Supercharger, but drivers can easily reach half or full battery capacity for free while shopping or staying at a hotel. Drivers' final charging option is to use their at-home charger, which is included with every Tesla vehicle purchase. The added utility expense varies based on location, but the average U.S. electricity rate runs about 13.2 cents per kWh -- less than half the price of using a Supercharger. \u00a0 With the ability to charge cheaply at home and free at over 4,500 destination chargers across the country, it's perfectly logical in many cases for a Tesla driver to never use a Supercharger. Essentially, the only use case for a Supercharger is a road trip, and even in those cases many drivers would likely choose other food, coffee, or shopping options in the area over Tesla's proposed retro diner while they wait. Knowing this, it is difficult to argue that it would be worth it for Tesla to invest so heavily in enhancing user experience in the less-frequented Supercharger network. Plus, considering the business incentive for being a Tesla Charging Partner, it's plausible to expect businesses to open destination chargers at a faster rate than Tesla launches new Supercharger stations. There is undoubtedly a lucrative captive market opportunity in electric vehicle charging in general. However, that opportunity will likely be more valuable for Tesla's Charging Partners via destination chargers than for Tesla via its Supercharger network because of the frequency of their respective usage and driver options during their charge time. Especially considering the restaurant industry's infamously razor-thin margins, most investors would prefer to see Tesla stay focused on expanding production capacity, recovering its sales slump in China, and fixing the  significant mistakes  it made in rolling out its solar roof business. If not, the diversion of company resources to a restaurant venture will very likely hurt the stock.

Musk is the founder and CEO of electric vehicle company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and said his company will once again start accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment once certain renewable-energy criteria are met. Considering some blame Musk for the current Bitcoin bear market, it seems only fitting that it's getting a boost from him today. Stocks tied to Bitcoin are also getting a boost today. As of 12:30 p.m. EDT, Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) stock is up 21%, Bit Digital (NASDAQ:BTBT) is up 25%, and Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) is up 18%. Finally, shares of cryptocurrency fund Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (OTC:GDLC) are up 12%. Image source: Getty Images. The price of Bitcoin crashed in May after Musk said Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin as a form of payment, citing concerns over lack of sustainable energy used in the mining process. At its high in May, Bitcoin was around $58,000. Following Musk's comments, it plummeted to around $35,000. But in a social media post yesterday, Musk said that Tesla isn't banning Bitcoin payments forever. First, the company needs to confirm around half of Bitcoin's electricity comes from green sources. Second, the mining process needs to be trending greener in general. It's unclear how Tesla will confirm Bitcoin's energy sources exactly. By some estimates, the blockchain network already far surpasses Musk's 50% benchmark. For example, according to a December 2019 study from CoinShares Research, 73% of Bitcoin's energy comes from renewable sources. However, the exact percentage is hotly debated. After all, not all miners disclose where they get their electricity. This uncertainty has some calling for more transparency among Bitcoin miners. Therefore, some companies have voluntarily coalesced to form the Bitcoin Mining Council.\u00a0These companies met for the first time on May 23. MicroStrategy is a founding member of the council, and its CEO Michael Saylor said on social media that the council will  standardize energy reporting.  Riot Blockchain, Bit Digital, and Marathon Digital are all companies that mine Bitcoin, and they know how important this renewable energy issue is becoming for Bitcoin. For example, on June 8, Bit Digital provided a transcript of CEO Bryan Bullett's presentation at the LD Micro Conference. There Bullett said,  As of April 2021, we estimated that we used a majority carbon-free energy, on an annualized weighted average basis, accounting for these seasonal migrations.  By  seasonal migrations  Bullett is referring to Bit Digital's strategy of moving miners to places that may have cheaper, renewable energy at certain times of year. Image source: Getty Images. Today's news about Tesla and Bitcoin may send the price of Bitcoin higher only in the short term -- it doesn't seem fundamental to a cryptocurrency-investing thesis. Consider that during the short time Tesla was theoretically allowing Bitcoin as a method of payment, it doesn't seem like anyone actually did it. And in reality it's hard to see what the advantage would be for a consumer anyway. Bitcoin investors believe the value will continue to rise over time. Therefore, it behooves them to hold Bitcoin rather than spend it. Comments today from billionaire Paul Tudor Jones are more fundamental to a long-term Bitcoin thesis. Jones appeared on CNBC today and said he wants 5% of his investments in Bitcoin.\u00a0Jones cited concerns over inflation of the U.S. dollar and high stock valuations, but the implications are far reaching. If more people, companies, and even countries buy and hold Bitcoin as Jones and others suggest, that could create a surge in demand that drives the price higher in the long term. A higher price for Bitcoin would obviously be good for companies like Marathon Digital, Riot Blockchain, and Bit Digital that directly operate in this space and even hold bitcoins on their balance sheets in some cases. But it would also be good for funds like Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund -- a diversified cryptocurrency fund that's 69% invested in Bitcoin.\u00a0 If you decide to take Jones' advice regarding Bitcoin, be mentally prepared for volatility. Even though Bitcoin's market capitalization is roughly $750 billion, a simple social media post from a celebrity still amazingly has the power to send coins moving by 10% or more with ease. Expect many more headline-grabbing endorsers and detractors in the coming weeks and months, making for one choppy ride. That may be more than most investors can mentally handle with 5% of their portfolios.\u00a0  "}, {"source": "Motley Fool", "title": "How Many Vehicles Will Tesla Deliver This Quarter?

Despite enduring pauses in its production during the pandemic, the electric-car maker still managed to grow its deliveries 36% year over year -- and that was against a tough comparison in 2019, when vehicle deliveries surged 50% year over year. Yet somehow, Tesla expects deliveries to grow even faster in 2021 than they did in both 2020 and 2019. After the company crushed analyst estimates last quarter, management's rosy outlook for 2021 is starting to look believable. But it may take another exceptional quarter before skeptics are convinced that Tesla's growth rate will accelerate this year. The interior of Tesla's refreshed Model S. Image source: Tesla. Tesla announced a 109% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries in Q1, so expectations are high for the automaker's second quarter. Of course, high expectations are also due to management's recent comments. In the company's first-quarter update, the company reiterated guidance for full-year deliveries to increase more than 50% from 2020 levels. For Tesla to be on track to hit this guidance, the automaker will likely have to more than double its second-quarter deliveries on a year-over-year basis. But this shouldn't be too hard -- if Tesla simply maintained its first-quarter 2021 vehicle deliveries of about 185,000, this would translate to a year-over-year growth rate of 104%. Further, Tesla essentially paused production of its Model S and X last quarter as it refreshed the models. With these two vehicles resuming production in Q2, this should help increase total deliveries. Finally, demand notably doesn't seem to be an issue. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in the company's first-quarter earnings release that  demand is the best we've ever seen.  In fact, the company's quarterly vehicle orders increased from Q4 to Q1 -- a time frame in which seasonality usually leads to a sequential reduction in orders. There are potential curveballs, however, that could negatively impact Tesla's deliveries in Q2. First, there have been global challenges with supply shortages. Even Tesla's chief financial officer Zachary Kirkhorn said in the company's first-quarter earnings call that there's  instability  in the global supply chain,  particularly around semiconductors.  He also noted capacity constraints at logistics and shipping ports. Second, since some of Tesla's vehicle growth this year is dependent on continued production-line expansion at the automaker's vehicle factories, it's always possible that the company runs into unforeseen challenges as it brings new-vehicle production tooling online. Overall, however, Tesla's commentary alongside its first-quarter results suggested that management has a high degree of confidence in its forecast for delivering 750,000 or more vehicles this year. With this in mind, Tesla's second-quarter vehicle deliveries will likely be greater than the record 185,000 vehicles it delivered in Q1.

Indeed, GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson says he believes Tesla's monthly vehicle deliveries in the important auto market have peaked at around 20,000.  Should this prove to be the case, that would take a massive chunk out of the TSLA bull case,  the analyst said in a note to investors on Tuesday. But one analyst remains resolutely bullish on Tesla shares: Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. Here are his thoughts on the China situation and the company's overall potential. Model X. Image source: Tesla. Though Ives admits that Tesla's second quarter may have started off rocky in China, he believes that things will smooth out over time since the market opportunity is so significant. He notes that he expects electric-vehicle sales as a percentage of total annual auto sales in the market to increase from 5% to 10% over the next 10 years. As a pure-play electric-vehicle manufacturer, Tesla is positioned to benefit, Ives believes. Further, the analyst notes that recently released data from China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) points to a 29% jump in monthly Tesla vehicle sales in May, compared to April -- though 11,527 of the 33,463 were exported. Nevertheless, with a reported 33,463 deliveries, the company's China manufacturing seems to be contributing meaningfully to Tesla's overall sales. For reference, Tesla delivered about 185,000 electric vehicles globally in its first quarter of 2021. Tesla has invested aggressively in the China market, building a major factory in Shanghai. Indeed, its China market currently has enough tooling installed to build 450,000 vehicles annually, though it may take time for Tesla to ramp up production enough to achieve this capacity.  Model Y ramp in Shanghai is progressing well,  Tesla said in its first-quarter update.  We expect that our Shanghai factory will continue to increase quarterly production output through the year.  Ives has a $1,000 12-month price target on Tesla stock, representing 67% upside from where shares are trading today. The analyst's $1,000 price target for the stock was established after Tesla announced first-quarter deliveries that crushed analyst estimates. At the time of his price-target increase, he said he thinks Tesla deliveries could exceed 850,000 this year -- a huge jump from approximately 500,000 deliveries last year. While these analyst opinions can be informative, investors should focus less on month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter deliveries and more on Tesla's year-to-year execution. It's difficult to gauge how a company's sales are trending or its expansion is faring over periods of months or quarters. Let's zoom out and see what happens for the full year. The automaker's total 2021 deliveries in China relative to its total deliveries in the market in 2020 and 2019 will likely be more telling about the company's long-term sales trajectory in the market.

Over that period, Tesla shares soared from about $40 to an all-time high of $900 in January -- a twentyfold gain that's outpaced the likes of\u00a0Amazon,\u00a0Apple, and\u00a0Alphabet. But since then, Tesla has shed nearly over a third of its market value. The stock is seeing downward pressure as traders\u00a0rotate from high-growth tech bets and into reopening plays such as banks. And a recent slew of negative headlines\u00a0regarding Tesla's sales in China and\u00a0vehicle recalls\u00a0hasn't helped, either. Investors who missed the boat last year -- when Tesla rallied over 700% -- may be wondering if it's time to buy the dip. Let's run over the bull and bear cases for Tesla before deciding whether to buy. Image source: Getty Images. For most of its 18-year existence, Tesla has been unprofitable. That all changed last year when Tesla reported its first-ever annual profit on the back of a 28%\u00a0 rise in revenue. To get there, Tesla sold almost\u00a0half a million vehicles\u00a0-- the most ever. While 2020 was a solid year, Tesla believes 2021\u00a0\u00a0will be even better. And so far, this has been the case. In the first quarter of 2021, Tesla set new records for car production and deliveries. Revenue\u00a0soared 74% from a year ago, \u00a0while net income jumped 2,638%. When it comes to Tesla, seeing the big picture is important. The company may be leading the charge when it comes to electric vehicles (EVs), but its share of the global auto market is\u00a0still very low. For context, car manufactures sell 70 million to 80 million new cars globally each year. Tesla sold almost 500,000 cars in 2020, implying a market share of less than 1%.\u00a0 While EVs are now a\u00a0seemingly unstoppable trend, most modern cars still run on an internal combustion engine (ICE). As a top dog in this industry, Tesla is set to ride the EV tailwind, growing its production volume for years to come. Even if Tesla grows its sales volume 10 times over, its market share will still be less than 10%. Beyond carmaking, Tesla is positioning itself for leadership in emerging industries such as ride-hailing and\u00a0autonomous vehicles. While it is still early days for these ventures, Tesla's\u00a0fans believe\u00a0the company has a serious shot at success. For example, Tesla has leveraged its global fleet of cars on the road to collect billions of miles of driving data -- helping improve its self-driving technology. In fact, as of March 2020, Tesla had collected 3 billion miles of data --\u00a0150 times more\u00a0than the 20 million miles of data collected by Alphabet's Waymo. Add into the mix CEO Elon Musk's gravity-defying track record as an entrepreneur, and bulls think they've got a solid case for Tesla\u00a0to keep growing at high rates. In the beginning, Tesla bears argued that EVs\u00a0would struggle\u00a0to go mainstream. That, in turn, fueled a narrative that Tesla would never be able to sell enough cars to\u00a0turn a profit. Tesla not only proved them wrong, but it also -- arguably -- kick-started\u00a0the ongoing EV revolution. Ironically, Tesla's success may be its undoing. Legacy automakers like\u00a0General Motors (NYSE:GM),\u00a0Ford (NYSE:F), and\u00a0Volkswagen (OTC:VWAGY) are\u00a0pouring billions into EV manufacturing, aiming to beat Tesla at its own game. As a rising number of established carmakers jump on the EV bandwagon, Tesla risks losing its first-mover advantage. After all, these companies have decades of experience producing and selling cars. In China, Tesla is up against longtime rival BYD\u00a0and EV upstarts like\u00a0Nio\u00a0and\u00a0Xpeng. These companies are\u00a0investing heavily to grow their market share -- and some could be better positioned to serve the needs of Chinese consumers.\u00a0 Beyond EV, Tesla is also facing intense competition in the autonomous vehicle industry. For example, Honda launched a new car installed with the world's first certified (by the Japanese government) level 3 autonomous driving technology earlier this March while Mercedes-Benz is set to launch its own level 3 autonomous car by the end of this year. While these latecomers might not have as much autonomous driving data (as compared to Tesla), they remain serious contenders in this autonomous driving race. What's more, this might also suggest that Tesla's early mover advantage (including its data advantage), is probably not that much of an advantage. After all, Tesla's self-driving system is only certified as a level 2 autonomous product by regulators.  Bears have also pointed out that Tesla's valuations seem detached from the real world. At $572, Tesla is trading at 17.6 \u00a0times sales. That's ludicrously expensive -- especially when you consider that General Motors trades at less than 1 times \u00a0sales. In other words, investors have priced in Tesla's potential to succeed in its existing EV business --\u00a0as well as\u00a0its newer businesses. Thus, buying Tesla stock at current valuation is a risky thing to do, as we don't know if these ventures will ever be a success. As a pioneering EV player, Tesla has huge room for growth in the auto industry. It is also charging into exciting industries like autonomous driving, ride-hailing, and renewable energy. On top of all this, Tesla is led by Elon Musk -- arguably among the best entrepreneurs of our time. But with competition\u00a0rising from multiple fronts, Tesla faces an uphill battle to defend its market share. Its new ventures will tread an unbeaten path, with unknown chances of success. For me, though, the real issue with Tesla is its\u00a0sky-high valuation. Even after losing almost 40% of its value, Tesla trades at a whopping 486\u00a0 times trailing-12-month earnings. Should Tesla fail to live up to the market's high expectations, investors might stop rewarding it with such a premium valuation. On top of that, any bad news related to Tesla could send the stock crashing down to earth. All told, investors should wait for a better entry point before buying the stock.

I already own a piece of all three, but let's see why these are three stocks that should bounce back nicely from the next crash.\u00a0 Image source: Getty Images. Recent IPOs are a great place to look for promising growth stocks that will get clobbered in the next market crash. Investors are likely to dump freshly public companies that are still unproven in the eyes of investors at a time when stability reigns supreme. Coupang is a name you want to keep high on the list of recent debutantes to check out in the next pullback. If you're not familiar with Coupang it's because you haven't taken the time to get to know the Amazon of South Korea. Coupang has 16 million active shoppers on its platform, a pretty big deal since that represents roughly a third of the country's adult population. Coupang hit the market at $35 three months ago, quickly topping out at $69 before giving most of that back now.\u00a0 Growth is on a tear. Revenue soared 55% in 2019, picking up the pace with a 91% burst last year. Net revenue climbed 74% (63% on a constant currency basis) in the first quarter of this year. The reason why Coupang is so attractive is because it's going to be hard for anyone -- yes, even Amazon -- to compete. Coupang has already ripped pages out of the leading online e-tailer's playbook. It has a network of 100 fulfillment centers to the point where it's just seven miles or less from 70% of everyone in South Korea. If you want groceries delivered, just place your order on Coupang before midnight. It'll be waiting by your front door before you wake up the next morning. Coupang even excels at restaurant takeout delivery, a platform that even Amazon couldn't make work.\u00a0 Every automaker that matters is making electric vehicles a priority. The always polarizing Tesla is already there. Tesla sold roughly half a million cars last year, no small feat in a pandemic when our vehicles were parked in the garage and new car sales languished. It's going to naturally sell even more in 2021. Tesla has some big first-mover advantages. It has 25,000 Tesla-dedicated Supercharger stations already installed, a moat that finds everyone else leaning on third-party charging stations that will never be proprietary or as reliable. Tesla's leading edge in self-driving technology will also make it hard to catch.\u00a0 Other car makers will copy Tesla's high-margin business model of over-the-air software for premium upgrades. Those that succeed will be taking market share from their legacy gas guzzlers, but not Tesla's promising growth trajectory. A lot of people are betting against Tesla these days, but that also happens to be a\u00a0bullish case for Tesla the next time the stock takes a hit. Like Coupang, Bumble is another 2021 IPO that has come down after its initial pop. It's not a broken IPO. Like Coupang, it's trading just above its debut price -- which in this case was $43 a share for its February IPO. There's a lot to like when it comes to Bumble. It operates the second- and fourth-highest grossing online dating apps in the world. The namesake app that makes up 66% of the revenue mix is growing faster than Tinder, the only online dating application that rakes in more money than Bumble. Revenue growth slowed to 19% last year, but give it a break. We were in a pandemic, and dating was pretty dangerous through most of 2020. The pick-up business is picking up now, with Bumble's revenue up 43% in this year's first quarter.\u00a0 The best is yet to come for Coupang, Tesla Motors, and Bumble. These are three growth stocks that I think you could consider buying the next time the market crashes.

But it also makes sense that a stock like Canaan, which produces integrated circuits used in mining Bitcoin in China, would surge in anticipation that support for Musk could lead to even more price increases for the cryptocurrency, encouraging more mining, and more buying of computers with which to mine. Finally, and to my mind perhaps most logically of all, is the rising price of CleanSpark. Generally speaking, CleanSpark makes software for energy regulation and energy efficiency, but more specifically, CleanSpark announced last month that through the use of  nuclear power, hydro-electric power, and solar,  it can now mine Bitcoin using energy that is  95% ... carbon-free  (and has a goal to soon be 98% carbon-free). \u00a0 That lines right up with the precondition that Elon Musk has set for getting Tesla back into the Bitcoin game -- and it would appear to make CleanSpark stock a logical beneficiary when he does.

Some stocks, most notably\u00a0Tesla\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA), have been highfliers as excitement about electric vehicles has grown. But there are a lot of risks that come with investing in an emerging technology, and inevitably not all of the dozens of EV stocks that have attracted investor attention in recent years will be good long-term investments.\u00a0 Of course, there will be some winners coming out of this period. Here's why three Fool controbutors believe Ford Motor (NYSE:F), Churchill Capital IV (Lucid Motors) (NYSE:CCIV), and EHang Holdings (NASDAQ:EH) are set to thrive over the long term. Image source: Getty Images. Lou Whiteman (Ford Motor):\u00a0Ford has gone from a 117-year-old dinosaur to buzzworthy in less time than it takes one of its Mustang sports cars to go from zero to 60. The company had been seen as a laggard in the electric vehicle revolution, but Ford changed all that last month when it laid out its strategy to transform the business into a 21st-century tech powerhouse. Ford unveiled an electric version of its mainstay F-150 pickup, announced plans to begin over-the-air updates to add computing power to its vehicles and open the door to optional revenue-generating services, and said it was going all-in on new tech. In the days since, Ford unveiled the Maverick, a new hybrid compact pickup truck that it believes will attract a new crowd to the pickup truck market. (Ford might be right. It's the first pickup I've ever wanted to own.) Ford has rarely, if ever, in recent memory made a misstep with its F-150, and the new Lightning electric version looks like a hit both with consumers and Ford's commercial customers. All-electric fleets make a lot of sense for big commercial operations, and Ford's rolling out a suite of new fleet management software features to small and mid-sized operators to help manage maintenance and reliability. In short Ford has not just crashed the gate to enter the electric vehicle party, it suddenly looks like one of the stars of the show. The shares have reacted accordingly, at least by traditional automaker standards, with the stock up 75% year to date. The stock rally isn't an overreaction. Rather, I believe it is a realization by the market that it had underappreciated Ford's wherewithal and ability to survive and thrive in this new world. It's a good time to kick the tires on this auto stock. John Rosevear (Churchill Capital IV/Lucid Motors):\u00a0I met Lucid Motors' CEO, Peter Rawlinson, at an auto show a few years back. At the time, Rawlinson -- who was, among other things, the chief engineer of Tesla's groundbreaking Model S -- was still building out Lucid's team and refining its prototype Air sedan. But he impressed me with his plan, which was to follow Tesla's path to the mass market without repeating what he clearly saw as some of Tesla's mistakes. Part of that plan involved doing something that Tesla has always seemed reluctant to do: drawing on the existing auto industry's best practices for manufacturing and product development. Rawlinson's plan was to fuse those best practices with the kind of innovation needed to build the next Tesla Model S. It sounded great at the time, and I've been impressed by how well he and his team have delivered so far. The Lucid Air, a sedan that promises to combine massive speed and range with genuine luxury, is the first product of that plan. Production of the Air will begin at Lucid's Arizona factory this fall, but there are already more Lucids in the pipeline, including a big luxury SUV and a battery-pack product similar to Tesla's Powerwalls. Lucid will begin shipping the first examples of its Air luxury sedan this fall. More Lucids, including a big SUV, will follow. Image source: Lucid Motors. The Air is a real luxury sedan with real luxury-sedan pricing, starting around $70,000 after tax credits and topping out at about $160,000. While Lucid does plan to introduce more affordable vehicles over the next few years, the scale of its ambitions is more modest than Tesla's grandiose  secret plan.  I actually think that's bullish, because it means that Lucid will have to deliver in order to earn a valuation more like Tesla's.\u00a0 I think the company has everything it needs to do exactly that.\u00a0 Right now, Lucid's valuation is less than 2% of Tesla's. While I do think that Tesla's stock price will come back to Earth at some point, I also think that shows us that Lucid -- the most promising EV start-up to go public so far -- has quite a bit of potential upside. Once the merger with Churchill Capital IV is completed later this month, the company's stock (which will trade under the  LCID  ticker) should be primed for a nice run as the first examples of the Air begin to reach customers.\u00a0 Rich Smith (EHang Holdings): I'll see your EV companies and raise you... straight up into the air. Competition in the electric car industry is fierce, with everyone from Tesla to NIO to General Motors trying to get a piece of the pie, and that fact creates the risk that while some companies may win in this industry, others are certain to lose. In contrast, an offshoot from the idea of electric cars that's recently been gaining traction is the idea of flying electric cars, also known as air taxis. And this is an industry where there's still very little competition to worry about. The leading pioneer in this new industry is China's EHang Holdings. It's been barely six months since we first started hearing about EHang, but already, the company is making a name for itself. In January, EHang held a demonstration in which a fleet of its EH216 autonomous aerial vehicles (i.e., pilotless, electrically powered, flying air taxis) carried 36 passengers on sightseeing trips in Guangdong, China. Sales in China have already begun, with 22 units sold last quarter. Last week, the company began laying the groundwork for taking its business international, announcing that it has begun conducting trial flights in Japan, preparatory to entering that market. \u00a0 Competition to EHang, meanwhile, is just getting started, with Brazil's Embraer announcing a partnership to manufacture air taxis of its own just last week. But while Embraer's first air taxis won't be ready for delivery before 2026, EHang says it is aiming to sell 250 units this year alone. What's more, EHang announced last month that it's already working on its first upgrade -- a  VT-30  long-range (inter-city) air taxi, with a flight range of 180 miles. \u00a0 Analysts think EHang could book its first full-year profit as soon as this year -- then nearly triple that profit to $0.66 per share in 2022. While EHang stock isn't cheap at a valuation of 63 times sales, it's certainly doing its best to grow into that valuation -- and if it keeps the growth up, I think it could thrive over the long term.

Nick Sciple: We got another question from [viewer] Amir, on the future and where things are going. He said,  Part of ARK's investment thesis in Tesla is high-margin software-as-a-service robotaxi revenue. What are your thoughts on that? Do you think any of other automakers that we're talking about will also offer that in the future to grow the revenue?  What do you think about the potential for Robotaxi revenue for these companies?  Then I think the follow-on question is, what do you think about the timeline for Robotaxi revenues for these companies? John Rosevear: As I understand it, part of ARK's very optimistic case for Tesla is that they're going to make a lot of money on software. I would note that's what we spent the first half hour talking about what Ford is doing. Tesla is going to do it, Ford is doing is, [General Motors]\u00a0is doing it, Volkswagen is doing it, Toyota will do it. It is a place to capture additional revenue. I would be hesitant to say any one automaker is going to capture most of that revenue. That's not how it works on autos. But for robotaxis, a good question, I don't think too many people are still holding onto the idea that your Tesla can go drive itself off when you're not using it and garner revenue for you and come back and be all ready. I think we're quite a few years away from that. I think we're a couple of years away from limited deployments and carefully mapped parts of cities. Cruise is talking about doing something in Dubai in a couple of years. Ford is talking about rolling out some limited self-driving service of some kind next year that maybe a passenger service or maybe a delivery service, a flight service. I think things like self-driving semis for highway use, tractor trailers are not all that far away. Tesla may play in that market. We'll see how the [Tesla] Semi actually does in the market. Again, that's a case where the income that's have a big advantage because of just fitting into fleets. But everybody I talk to who is much smarter than me about self-driving technology says it's a long way off. It is still a long way off. I think even Waymo has conceded that at this point. It's not a two- or three-years thing. We'll see where we are by 2028, I think. Maybe there will be a breakthrough and things will happen faster. Five years ago, we all thought by 2025, there would be no more car business. Not we all, but there were people saying that because we'd all be driving robotaxis everywhere. Clearly, that's not where we're going to be by 2025. I'm not sure it's where we're going to be ever, but there is a place for robotaxis if we can really make some on any realistic timeframe. I think the last year or two has been a case of just pushing those timeframes out further and further. If you are betting that Tesla or Cruise or Waymo or anybody else is going to nail this in the next 12-18 months, I would take the other side of that bet. If you are betting that all three of those companies and many more could profit from these in seven to 10 years, I like that bet better. Sciple: Still very uncertain on whether these services can really get rolled out. There was a story last week where Waymo has been first-to-market in developing autonomous vehicles, has a service running in Chandler, Arizona. There was a video you can go watch on YouTube of the car got stuck, then the car ran away from the service crew, was blocking two lanes of traffic, this and the other. This is what we think of as the market leader and that has been developing this for a decade. I think when you look at the actual and if you can look at some videos of the Tesla full self-driving package for folks that it's been unlocked for, when you see the actual performance of these things on the ground, I don't know how you can look on that and say all of a sudden, this revenue stream is going to turn on anytime in the near term. I think Cathie Wood is very smart, I thing she has some very strong models, had some good success in the past. If it was me, I would not be modeling any of that in these companies' revenue. I think it's far too uncertain. Rosevear: I wouldn't either. Not yet. I mean, you can look at what this might be by 2030, but don't build that into your near-term price case for the stock. Hold that out as if these hurdles are left in a timely way before some of the competitors could see this. But don't bet your retirement on it. Sciple: We'll see. We've been talking about self-driving cars going on 10 years now. It seems like so. It's to the point where we've been told the story for a while, I'm ready to see some results. For me, I'm not really going to be baking in real valuations on many of these companies until I see actual services up and running. We've only really got that from Waymo, and Waymo hasn't really expanded very much in the past few years, so still a lot to be proven out there. John, thank you so much for joining me for this last hour. "}, {"source": "Motley Fool", "title": "Will EVs Make Ford Stock a Multibagger?

That could give Ford's stock a nice boost -- but will it be enough to make Ford a  multibagger  with gains rivaling those of EV makers like Tesla\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA)? In this Motley Fool Live broadcast, recorded on May 27, Industry Focus host Nick Sciple and Motley Fool senior auto specialist John Rosevear take a look at that question -- and talk about why even if Ford's stock price doesn't soar like Tesla's, it could still offer investors market-beating performance as it moves to embrace a zero-emissions future.   Nick Sciple:\u00a0A reader asks -- this is a good question. We can probably talk about it from a few angles, it says,  Can Ford multibag from this point? Their market cap is well below that of Tesla. Comments? Thanks.  What do you think? We can look at Ford's market cap today. I think it's like $80 billion, $57.44 billion according to Google here. What do you think? Do you think Ford has potential to multibag from here or is it more of an income play as the dividend resumes? What do you think? John Rosevear: Well, I've been watching the auto business a long time, so I'm going to say, by older metrics, there's incremental growth here and you collect that tasty dividend, which should come back at $0.15 a quarter, $0.60 a share, I don't know what that would yield now, but I know it's pretty attractive. But clearly, you look at Tesla's valuation, you look at Ford's valuation, you look at where you think the companies are going over the next several years, clearly, one of these things is not like the other and something needs to correct in there. I don't think Ford is going to $300 a share. I would believe $30. At the same time, we think Tesla's probably got to settle back down from its crazy run last year, too. I don't think too many people will be surprised if that continues to happen and Tesla setting out at something that's a little more realistic for its likely 2030 prospects. Is Ford going to multibag? It would really surprise me, but lots of things in the auto business have surprised me in the last five years. [laughs] I don't know. I would not bet heavily on it. I am a Ford shareholder and I'm going to hold onto it, but I'm thinking more in terms of incremental gains from the dividend and some stock price gains, maybe a double from here as the bottom line grows, but I wouldn't think multibag, I don't think. [laughs] Sciple: Yeah, you've got to remember, this is a 100-plus-year-old company, Ford Motors, and it's a 100-plus-year-old industry. There are more registered cars on the road than there are licensed drivers. This isn't like the auto industry can have some big, incredible growth in terms of units delivered. It's more converting and finding these other revenue streams. I think Ford can certainly go up from here. I wouldn't view Tesla as this is how big Ford could be. I think Tesla's market cap is probably a little high relative to what the business would support today. You could argue that Ford is maybe a little bit underappreciated, although so far this year, the market has started to accept the story of the big autos in EV in a much more significant way than they had over the past few years. Rosevear: I do want to make one point related to that, which is somebody said to me yesterday, all Ford is doing is defending its turf, and I said, yeah, but Ford is priced as if it's going to cede its turf. Ford roughly holds onto its market share in pickups, SUVS, commercial vans, things like that, while getting similar profitability on the hardware to what it gets on ICE now once the EV technology matures after 2025 or so, and getting additional revenue, profit from the adjacencies, the software, the services, and so forth. There is an incremental growth story here, but at the same time, yeah, if Ford is successfully defending its turf, you've got to look at some of these upstarts and say, is Lordstown Motors\u00a0going to go to battle with Ford in the commercial vehicle space, for instance? We'll replay versions of that story as the other incumbents do or don't step up here, but yes, it is a defense play, but maybe Ford was priced for losing some ground, but that said, no, I don't think this is a 10-bagger from here. I wish because like I said, I've held it for a long time. I bought it in 2009 at, I won't tell you, but it was under two bucks a share, [laughs] I've been sitting on it for a long time and I'd love it if it went way higher, but I think incremental bottom-line growth, share price growth plus the dividend is the real story here.

The flagship cryptocurrency lost $1 trillion in market cap last month, and this downward spiral has a mix of factors at play. In May, Elon Musk's tweet about Tesla not accepting Bitcoins wiped off 10% of its value. Later that month, China's crackdown on cryptocurrencies pushed Bitcoin below $30,000. And the IRS calling for stringent reporting on large crypto transfers added to the woes.\u00a0 So, has the tide turned against Bitcoin permanently? The situation might be rattling for new investors, but if you have traced the journey of Bitcoin, this is nothing new. According to analysts, investors who owned Bitcoin for one to six months spurred the sell-off. Nevertheless, institutional investors, big corporations, and analysts are still pretty confident of Bitcoin's price rebound.\u00a0 Image Source: Getty Images Here are three main reasons to explain that the current Bitcoin crash is nothing to worry about. Institutional investors include large public and private companies as well as fund houses that invest in Bitcoin-related products. Jack Dorsey-led Square invested an additional $170 million in Bitcoin in February 2021. In the same month, Microstrategy spent more than $1 billion in high-yield debt to acquire additional bitcoins. In March 2021, Morgan Stanley became the first big U.S. bank to offer access to Bitcoin funds to its high net worth clients.\u00a0 Institutional investors aren't just hooked on Bitcoin for the price appreciation. They view the currency as a credible store of value and a hedge against economic instability. The continued influx of large corporations can single-handedly push Bitcoin into the mainstream. Bloomberg claims\u00a0rapid bitcoin adoption indicates a bullish growth phase. The media giant also predicted bitcoin's price to reach $400,000 by the end of Q4 2021. Besides institutional investors, many governments are also viewing cryptocurrencies in a new light. El Salvador recently declared Bitcoin as a legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. Speculation is rife that India might also recognize Bitcoin as an asset class. Moreover, the U.S., UK, Finland, Canada, and Germany already have a positive stance over Bitcoin. These initiatives could perpetually alter the way investors and regulators view Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies and make them mainstream.\u00a0 50% of Bitcoins were mined by January 2009, but the remaining 50% will be mined in more than 120 years. This is because of a unique event called 'halving' that Bitcoin undergoes every four years. The miners' reward is reduced to half every four years or after mining every 210,000 blocks. Thus, the supply of Bitcoin relative to the demand declines, and the price climbs. Historically, Bitcoin has always experienced an upward spiral after a halving event. After the first halving in 2012, the price of Bitcoin surged 90x.\u00a0 The next event is due in 2024, and we can expect the cryptocurrency to see a bull run after that. However, the market has now matured since 2012, and the impact might not be too pronounced this time. Also, it could take four to six months for the price appreciation to fructify. Hence, you may buy Bitcoin before the halving event, but only if you plan to hold it over the long term.\u00a0 Though the current scenario suggests otherwise, the game is not over for Bitcoin. It has an inherent value, and a few tweets cannot shake it. As for the regulatory landscape, I would say that stricter laws are indeed awaiting the cryptocurrencies. But better regulation will only enhance the credibility and prompt investors to pick Bitcoin with more conviction.\u00a0 Bitcoin price movements are a simple play of supply and demand. Unlike stocks, there aren't any fundamentals at play. So when investors are optimistic about the future of cryptocurrency, they buy more of it, and the price climbs. On the contrary, when their belief in the currency begins to shake, they sell-off. There is no doubt that Bitcoin has come under pressure, and it could take some time to recover due to regulatory headwinds and global macro risk. However, further declines below this point, if any, will be transient.\u00a0 Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset, and you can hold them as a part of a diversified portfolio over the long term. However, don't be surprised to see such dramatic price fluctuations periodically because that's very typical of cryptocurrencies. So, be sure to invest money only to the extent that you are OK to lose. Also, don't try to time the markets because, with an asset so volatile, timing can bring a rude shock.

The rise of the company since 2015 has been nothing but remarkable, mostly thanks to its CEO Lisa Su.

But can things be too good to be true? Can AMD continue to grow?\u00a0 Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) struggle is one factor behind AMD's success. Intel is still struggling with manufacturing after years of delays for its 10-nanometer chips. AMD uses TSMC (NYSE:TSM) to build its latest Ryzen and EPYC chips, giving it access to cutting-edge manufacturing processes. AMD provides chips for the latest PlayStation and Xbox game consoles as well as Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) in-car gaming rig. Strong demand for those consoles has boosted AMD's results. AMD's revenue soared 93% in the first quarter, and net income more than tripled.\u00a0 Back in 2006, AMD reached 20% market share and that's as high as it got for the company. Back then it was Intel who was the one stealing AMD's lunch. Will history repeat itself? Back in February, it was reported that Intel got some market share back for the first time in three years. AMD no longer manufactures its own chips, so the company doesn't have to pour cash into keeping up with Intel on the manufacturing side. But that would mean that AMD is entirely dependent on securing capacity at third-party foundries such as TSMC. Intel recently announced a $20 billion factory expansion in Arizona where it will be offering contract manufacturing jobs, and this will become a core part of the business. Could AMD turn into Intel's client? Only time will tell but as of now, AMD's future looks bright -- but expect Intel to give it a run for its money.\u00a0 Watch the video below for the full insights. *Stock prices used were the closing prices of June 14, 2021.

After all, if Ford is simply defending its pickup-truck turf from new entrants as the world transitions to electric vehicles, how could that be bullish?\u00a0 But it turns out that some of the opportunities enabled by the new truck could well be bullish for Ford's sales and profits. In this Motley Fool Live broadcast, recorded on May 27, Industry Focus host Nick Sciple and Motley Fool senior auto specialist John Rosevear take a closer look at how the F-150 Lightning fits into Ford's profit-growth plan -- and why even defending its turf is arguably bullish for Ford's stock right now.\u00a0 A transcript is below.\u00a0   Nick Sciple: You mentioned the new electric truck that Ford revealed, the F-150 Lightning, that's gotten a ton of headlines in the past few weeks. Of course, the F-Series is the highest-selling vehicle in North America. How does the F-150 Lightning plug into the strategy and what do you think about the potential for that vehicle more broadly? John Rosevear: Well, I think the potential is huge, I think the world has been waiting for it. Ford will tell you that, particularly their fleet customers have been waiting for it, that they are under some pressure, regulatory pressure in some states, but also corporate pressures, internal pressures to green up to go to more sustainable solutions, to go to more zero-emission solutions. Again, it fits right in, starting next year, we can ship you electric pickups, zero emissions. They're easy to recharge and has a ton of features where it can charge on AC power so that commercial customers don't have to dig trenches and install new equipment to do DC fast charging and so forth. They can do all of this, they can just plug into their existing systems with some simple electrical upgrades, packet base, or whatever, or the driver can take it home. There are some businesses where the driver takes the truck or the delivery van home at night, they can recharge it. Ford chargers will note how much electricity is going to the truck and then make sure that the driver gets reimbursed for that portion of their electric bill. They've thought this out really thoroughly. For instance, they've spent three years scoping all this and you can really see it, it is huge. There's also a more subtle part to this strategy, which is that Ford knows they can sell this truck right now, certainly when it ships next spring to a lot of its fleet customers. Retail has been a little more of an uncertain thing. We don't know how retail electric vehicle adoption is going. Certainly, early reservations on the F-150 have been very promising. But the more subtle thing is, I think Ford season opportunity, you get people driving the electric transit, the electric F-150 at work, and they come home and say, electric vehicle's really nice, I think it's got a great truck, it's got a great pick-up, it's quiet, everything works really well. Maybe we want one of those, maybe I want one of those as my personal truck. Maybe when friends ask me,  Are these electric vehicles for me?  You can say,  Yeah, I drive one at work, it's great.  There is that word of mouth into audiences that buy a lot of trucks perhaps, that will benefit Ford over time as well. It is a big deal. The F-150 is a huge part of that, but don't sleep on also the electric Transit which is coming later this year, and it is really optimized for fleet buyers. They look at how much range do our customers really need, we'll give them some extra but I forget what it is like 180 miles of range they're putting in the van. The first thing all the Tesla\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA) fans say,  Haha, that's nothing,  and then Ford says,  Well, if I'd tell you the average van driver in our customer base and we have thousands and thousands of these that we track, drives 125 miles a day, what do they need anymore? They just need to be able to plug it in every night and have it ready to go in the morning. It's a really thoroughly thought out product tools for jobs, and this is all again under the Ford Pro brand subgroup within Ford that Ted Cannis is running. Nick Sciple: One other thing, while we're on the topic of the new F-150 Lightning you mentioned earlier Ford defending its territory against some of these new entrants, Lordstown Motors is one example that's good to come to market. You've had Tesla with their Cybertruck. How do you think about what the competitive landscape is starting to look like in this EV truck market? John Rosevear: On the commercial side, good luck competing with Ford. Unless you're General Motors, good luck competing with Ford. The odds that a commercial fleet buyer is going to take a chance on an untested company, untested product when they know they can get a Ford next spring, I think the bull case for [Lordstown Motors] now has some very big problems because their whole bet is that they could get some share in commercial vehicles, electric pickup trucks specifically before the big guys got there, and now that doesn't look so good. On the retail side, it's a much more interesting picture. That's not where Lordstown is going. It is where Rivian is going at the higher-end. Whether a truck in the 70, $80,000 space, it's a luxury truck. It's a little smaller than an F-150. Their pickup, they also do an SUV on the same architecture, on the same skateboard as we say now. I think the F-150 will challenge them a little bit at the high-end because, of course, as Ford does, the retail truck will come in several different tiers, including a loaded luxury tier that will go up around $90,000 with fancy leather seats and the great stereo and all this stuff. Tesla to me is somewhat of a question mark in the middle there. I look at the Cybertruck and I say that is really not tailored for fleet users. I'm sure somebody will buy 10 of them to deliver pizzas and/or whatever. [laughs] But when you look at the commercial vehicle businesses in North America and Europe, the Cybertruck doesn't fit into there at all. That's a real question mark to me. We talked about a $40,000 price point, that would certainly be lower. But I still think this is a niche product for Tesla fans, rather than something that's going to actually seriously threaten vehicles like the F-150, and like GM's pickups, Stellantis' Ram pickups, and so forth. That's where I'm seeing it right now. We'll find out how this all goes in a year or so that when these trucks actually come to market, something they'll do.

That's created a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity in the industry that extends from electrical power generation to electric vehicles and energy storage.\u00a0 As we look at opportunities with decades of potential growth, three of our contributors identified\u00a0General Motors (NYSE:GM), Lucid Motors through Churchill Capital Corp IV (NYSE:CCIV), and NIO (NYSE:NIO) as renewable energy stocks that could crush the market. They're not traditional renewable energy stocks, but they are bringing a lot of disruption to the energy industry long term.\u00a0 Image source: Getty Images. Travis Hoium (General Motors): Renewable energy comes in a lot of forms and doesn't have to be just about wind and solar replacing energy sources like coal and natural gas. A large portion of the energy we consume is in the form of oil in vehicles. Making the transition to electric vehicles in the mass market is critical to using more renewable energy, and General Motors will be a key to mass-market EVs.\u00a0 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) gets most of the attention in the EV market, but GM is investing $27 billion in EV and autonomous vehicle product development between 2020 and 2025 and expects to deliver 1 million electric vehicles globally by 2025. The company has already announced the Chevy Bolt, Cadillac LYRIQ, GMC Hummer EV, and an upcoming Silverado electric pickup, but that's likely just the start. Forty percent of models are expected to be electric by 2025 and management thinks the entire fleet could be electric by 2035.\u00a0 The impact on energy could be enormous. Replacing a gasoline-powered engine with electricity allows users to power their vehicles with wind or solar if they've chosen that form of electricity generation. EV charging networks could be powered entirely by renewables. And EV owners are more likely to also have a solar system on their roof, increasing the odds of onsite renewable energy production.\u00a0 To take GM's renewable energy shift to the next level, the company's Cruise subsidiary has committed to using  100% renewable energy  for its electric-powered Origin autonomous ride-sharing vehicle. I think Cruise could ultimately be the\u00a0biggest asset in GM's portfolio, and if it disrupts vehicle ownership and is run on renewable energy it could make GM one of the biggest reasons the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy is possible.\u00a0 Daniel Foelber\u00a0(Lucid Motors): Lucid Motors, which plans to raise $4.6 billion when it merges with a SPAC called Churchill Capital IV, has seen its shares climb upwards of 35% over the last month.\u00a0The company plans to begin delivering its highly anticipated luxury sedan, the Lucid Air Dream Edition, in the second half of this year. With a price tag of $169,000 before federal tax credits, the Dream Edition is by no means cheap. But Lucid plans to phase in three additional trims of the Air between now and 2023. The lowest-priced trim, the Lucid Air Pure, would start at a sticker price below $70,000, assuming a federal tax credit of $7,500.\u00a0 Tapping into the ultra-competitive luxury car market is usually ill-advised. But in Lucid's case, the company has legitimate advantages that give it an edge over rivals like Tesla. With a management team that's a cross between Silicon Valley, legacy automaker, and ex-Tesla employees, Lucid is chock-full of top tier talent. It has spent the last five years designing its own technology and plans to build it all in-house at its production plant in Casa Grande, Arizona. Lucid's Dream Edition has a projected EPA-rated range of 503 miles and 1,080 horsepower, which would make it the first EV to exceed the coveted 500-mile threshold. Its bidirectional 900-volt architecture lets it charge up to 300 miles in less than 20 minutes, as well as power a home if needed. The company's fully integrated powertrain with a smaller, lower-cost battery pack makes it one of the most efficient EVs in terms of miles per kWh.\u00a0 The company sees the global luxury car market growing from just under $500 billion in 2018 to upwards of $730 billion by 2026, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 5%.\u00a0But Lucid thinks it will be able to grow much faster than that. It expects to deliver 20,000 vehicles in 2022, earning $2.2 billion in revenue and $34 million in gross profit. After rolling out more affordable trims of the Lucid Air, it expects 2023 gross profit to exceed $1 billion and revenue to grow at a CAGR of over 59% between 2022 and 2026.\u00a0 Lucid's future hinges on its ability to hit deadlines and maintain a technological edge over the competition. Given that the company is in the early innings of its growth strategy, investors should expect plenty of volatility, as well as adjustments to timelines and performance forecasts. For risk-tolerant investors looking for a growth stock in the burgeoning EV space, Lucid seems to offer one of the best risk-reward profiles out there. Howard Smith (NIO): It's not often that one would designate the stock of a company that almost went out of business as unstoppable. As recently as early 2020, NIO's business flirted with bankruptcy. But a push by the Chinese government to accelerate growth in the country's EV industry contributed to strong sales growth, and investors piled in.\u00a0 The company continues to rapidly grow sales inside China, the largest automotive market globally, and the one with the most potential for EVs. But NIO has also recently announced plans to move into Europe, which is also a huge market. What was once a stock with a market capitalization approaching $100 billion has dropped about 25%. That doesn't make it cheap, but with what looks like a business that can grow for decades, it's one that could justify a higher-risk investment.\u00a0 Interior of NIO ET7 electric luxury sedan. Image source: NIO. Vehicle deliveries increased by 113% in 2020 compared to the prior year. But for the first quarter of 2021, NIO delivered 20,060 vehicles representing an increase of 423% year over year. Like many other automakers, the company's production has recently been hit by the global semiconductor chip shortage. But assuming that will be a short-term impact, there's plenty more to look forward to.\u00a0 NIO announced it will begin production on its first sedan, the luxury ET7, early next year. And the company will begin sales in Europe, starting with Norway, in September 2021. NIO said it will initially sell its flagship ES8 electric SUV in Norway, followed by the new ET7 luxury sedan. And later in 2022, it will install battery swap stations in the country, replicating the network it has in place in China. The charging and battery swap program brings in additional subscription revenue to the company.\u00a0 NIO is adding another manufacturing plant, and its expansion outside of China should continue. With the expected demand for EVs globally, NIO looks to be a long-term growth story that can't be stopped.\u00a0 We've all chosen car companies as our renewable energy stocks that can't be stopped and there's a good reason behind that. The transition to electric vehicles is happening rapidly and GM, Lucid, and NIO are leading the way. That will not only replace gasoline-powered vehicles, but it could also add backup power to homes. EVs and backup power have years and maybe decades of growth ahead and that's why the EV industry is the focus of our picks today.\u00a0  "}, {"source": "The Motley Fool", "title": "Why Marathon Digital Holdings Stock Fell 33% in May ", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/09/why-marathon-digital-holdings-stock-fell-33-in-may/", "date": "Wed, 09 Jun 2021 20:37:05 GMT", "content": "Shares of cryptocurrency mining specialist  Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) fell 32.6% in May 2021, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. It's no coincidence that the price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) also fell approximately 33% last month. It's not that Marathon didn't have any news of its own in May. The company reported mixed first-quarter results, added two new names to its boardroom, and planned out a 300-megawatt Bitcoin mining location in Texas. Marathon mined 192 Bitcoin tokens in the first quarter and invested $150 million in buying another 4,813 Bitcoins. But the market largely shrugged off all of these moves to focus on a shaky Bitcoin chart instead. Bitcoin's travails in May have been well documented elsewhere, but here's a high-level overview. The leading cryptocurrency entered the month with prices north of $57,000 per token, itching to cement a two-month period of relative stability. Instead, Bitcoin prices fell sharply amid an avalanche of negative developments. Chinese regulators cracked down on cryptocurrency trading in general, Tesla\u00a0suspended the option to pay for your next electric car in Bitcoin, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk started sending mixed messages about cryptocurrency investments. All of this happened during a tough earnings season for technology stocks as a whole, which created a marketwide retreat from volatile high-growth investments and into ultra-stable value assets. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fit the bill to a T, adding to the Chinese and Tesla-based sell-side pressure. Image source: Getty Images. Bitcoin prices have been volatile in early June as well, mixing a couple of good days into a broadly negative trend. Marathon's stock has largely followed suit, as expected. Whenever Bitcoin goes through a bull market, crypto-mining stocks such as Marathon tend to amplify the uptrend and soar to incredible new heights. The same goes for bear markets and crashing stock prices. Marathon investors kind of dodged a bullet in May from that perspective, simply matching the Bitcoin market's downward move rather than magnifying it. Bitcoin itself looks like a peaceful oasis of stability next to Marathon, and that's saying something. Ambitious investors may want to pick up a few Marathon shares at these lower prices but the stock was never exactly cheap and the market risks are still massive. Keep your Marathon buys small and speculative. The stock might skyrocket if the Bitcoin bull market reignites, or crash and burn if cryptocurrencies take a nosedive and Marathon runs out of cash instead.

You might think that domination will come under threat as the world transitions to electric and connected vehicles -- but it turns out that Ford has a sophisticated plan to not just defend its turf with its own electric vehicles, but to actually boost the revenue generated by its commercial vehicle business. The secret? New software offerings tailored specifically for its fleet customers. In this Motley Fool Live broadcast, recorded on May 27, Industry Focus host Nick Sciple and Motley Fool senior auto specialist John Rosevear take a closer look at Ford's strategy to boost its revenue -- and its profits -- as commercial fleets transition to zero-emissions vehicles.\u00a0   Nick Sciple:\u00a0You mentioned Ford Pro and that strategy. Where this really starts to sing I think, is in that commercial vehicles strategy and Ford Pro, the services they can offer to some of those customers. What is Ford laying out there and what's the thesis behind that part of the business? John Rosevear: Their thesis, first of all, is that they are the market leader in commercial vehicles by which we mean the pick-ups, transit vans, the small vans, and so forth. In some countries, it's the Rangers, not F-Series. They are the market leader in that kind of business in North America and in Europe, and they have a good presence in China. They are not the market leader in China, but they have a good presence, a growing presence. This is good profitable business that they want to defend from the likes, not so much of Tesla, but from companies like maybe Lordstown Motors, a\u00a0start-up building a commercial pickup truck, or Workhorse Group building a commercial electric delivery van. They want to come out and say,  Hey, we're the market leader, you should be doing business with us.  Fleets that have heavy installed, Ford vehicles they may own 15, they may own 100, they may own 500, they may own 5,000. Ford says their fleet customers tend to replace 10-15% of the fleet per year. They want to make it super easy for them to come to Ford and buy the electric, and it merges and meshes seamlessly with their existing internal combustion Fords in terms of operations, in terms of software, in terms of service, in terms of who you call when there's a problem, all of that. They think that's a big opportunity for them and that as they add these additional software, fleet logistics, fleet management, charging services, and so forth, is that they can make a significant gain in revenue and profit from their existing commercial fleet business while defending it from new entrants. It's both sides of that. Sciple: I think one of the interesting things you talked about some of these older automakers and Tesla going away from the dealership model. I think in this instance, in this commercial fleet side of the business, that's where the dealership really can provide a significant advantage for Ford relative to some other folks out there, just because you can't have these vehicles not being serviced very quickly and back on the market. How do you think Ford's advantage there plugs into where they can build out this Pro business? Rosevear: It's absolutely huge. As the Ford people stay over and over uptime, it's everything. If the vehicle it's not running, it's not earning money today, and if you're a small or mid-sized business, one vehicle down is a big deal. Its dealers, it's also Ford itself, it's also what they call outfitters. When you see a Ford-based truck come from the phone company and it's got work boxes on the back, if they come to put it in your windshield in and have a special rack to hold windshields on the back, but it's a Ford-based chassis. That's part of what they're protecting, too. The new electric F-150, they can take all of the existing parts since Ford says they have the same attachment points as the existing internal combustion models, so all of that equipment will transfer over. It can be unbolted and bolted right back on the new electric vehicle. That's important. But to the dealer relationships, that's also super important. Getting these vehicles serviced quickly, using apps, using software to diagnose problems in the vehicle, maybe while it's still not running its daily route and say, they're showing a sensor problem, you can get through the route and get back to base, but we'll need somebody to come over and look at it tonight or something, and they can set that up on the fly as they're going. Maybe the driver reports a problem and maybe it's just an alert that comes up in the dispatcher's software,  Truck 32 needs a service visit quick,  and you can set that up on the fly. There may even be a way where that sort of pings the dealer or two and says,  You may get a call on this.  There is a lot of this sort of thing that Ford is already shipping and that they are going to significantly upgrade. Again, this is recurring revenue. They are not a ground breaker in this space because this software exists, but as they point out, it's mostly used by large fleet operators. Ford says,  That's fine when we sell Fords to large fleet operators that will work with that software, it's not a problem,  but they have a big opportunity. They think with the smaller and mid-sized fleets, a lot of their commercial customers who don't have access to those big software packages if they can just get it one by one as they buy the new trucks and for a modest fee that's affordable to them and scaled to their business. They think that's a big opportunity for them because there isn't really anybody in that space who can do it the way they can.

Damage caused by cybercrime is expected to cost up to $6 trillion globally in 2021 according to Cybersecurity Ventures, so companies can't afford to skimp on protection. As more networks migrate to the cloud, over 450 of the Forbes global 2,000 companies have sought assistance from Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS).\u00a0 The company offers a wide range of products and services to make cloud operations safe and secure. Although it's still operating at a loss, the business is scaling quickly, gearing its additional investments toward bolstering its presence in ransomware. Cybercrime is only growing more dangerous, so Zscaler shares might be a good place for your money going forward.\u00a0 Image source: Getty Images. Zscaler takes a cloud-based approach to cybersecurity. This is designed to protect company networks and assets, even when employees are accessing them remotely, for example. Put simply, Zscaler acts as a filter between a device and the internet to protect against cyber threats on the way to accessing assets online. Since it is cloud-based, it doesn't require any additional hardware or software installed on devices, or on-premises.\u00a0 The company also offers a private access solution (ZPA), designed to build a secure perimeter around an entity's applications. Since connectivity is increasingly moving away from company networks and onto the internet, it's important to implement security where those connections happen. Zscaler Private Access works on zero-trust network access, where every user needs to adhere to strict identification requirements -- whether they're a part of the network or not. This makes the applications behind the protective layer virtually invisible to outsiders, because they're never directly exposed to the internet.\u00a0 Zscaler is also an authorized networking partner for Microsoft Office 365. In an age where collaborative live documents have changed the way we work, it's as important as ever to focus on protecting the data contained in those shared files. Over 4,500 companies have used Zscaler to deploy Office 365. For the fiscal 2021 third quarter, which was just announced, Zscaler generated $176.4 million in revenue, up 60% year over year. However, the company's net loss more than tripled to $58.4 million -- attributable to more aggressive spending on marketing, research and development, and interest payments on debt. The loss was a reduction on a sequential basis, though.\u00a0 Zscaler is a software-as-a-service company with high gross margins, so in theory it has the flexibility to run high costs to grow its business, and cut them back in the future to generate net profits.\u00a0 Metric Fiscal Q4 2020 Fiscal Q1 2021 Fiscal Q2 2021 Fiscal Q3 2021 Revenue (millions) $125.9 $142.6 $157.0 $176.4 Deferred Revenue* (millions) $369.8 $371.9 $446.8 $495.4 GAAP Net Loss $49.5 $55.0 $67.5 $58.4 DATA SOURCE: COMPANY FILINGS. *DEFERRED REVENUE RELATES TO ADVANCED PAYMENTS FOR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED IN THE FUTURE. GAAP = generally accepted accounting principles. Overall, the company is doing a good job managing its losses as revenue ramps up, even with the key acquisitions of small cloud start-ups TrustDome and Smokescreen Technologies.\u00a0Zscaler will continue to invest in developing these new technologies, with the goal of integrating them into its main products and services to bolster future revenue growth.\u00a0 With $601.9 million in trailing 12-month revenue and a market capitalization of $25 billion, its revenue multiple is about 43 times. While this is extremely high -- even higher than high-flyer Tesla, for example -- at the current rate of growth, the stock could begin to look cheap within a couple of years. Not to mention, Zscaler's stock is down about 13% from its highs, and if it continues to dive, it will bring down that lofty revenue multiple even further.\u00a0 The company has a clear focus on growth instead of profitability in the short term, as it outlined in the recent Q3 earnings call. This might cause persistent losses for now, but could be key to big earnings results in the future.\u00a0 The global cybersecurity industry was about $162 billion in size in 2020, and is expected to grow to $418 billion by 2028 -- so Zscaler has a significant market opportunity. As cybercrime continues to cause a growing amount of damage, this estimate might even be conservative.\u00a0 However, there is a lot of competition in this space. Zscaler has some advantages, in that it's already acquired highly valuable customers that will likely be reluctant to switch providers (big companies find major systems changes burdensome). It also has a very non-invasive product that doesn't require large-scale installations across company networks or devices, which makes the user experience rather seamless. Finally, Zscaler is already recognized as the leader in this space -- so it's in a strong position to advance its business.  With over $1.4 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments, Zscaler is well capitalized to continue investing in growth. Investors should watch for revenue performance in the coming quarters, to see if the company can keep up its current pace.

", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/16/is-ipo-stock-uipath-a-buy-after-its-first-quarter/", "date": "Wed, 16 Jun 2021 12:00:00 GMT", "content": "As the economy recovers from the effects of the pandemic, businesses across the country are reporting difficulty hiring employees and a shortage of workers. Some have left to work for themselves, others have quit simply to recapture some life-work balance. There has been concern vocalized in the past over AI's potential to eliminate jobs, but the fact of the matter is AI could be a necessary tool to help organizations evolve in a post-pandemic world that has a shortage of employee help. Software-based automation could have massive potential as a result. Enter robotic process automation (RPA) company UiPath (NYSE:PATH). The company just went public this past spring and had a fantastic showing in its first quarter since its initial public offering. It isn't a cheap stock, but if you are looking very long-term, it could be time to start nibbling. Image source: Getty Images. UiPath is the leader in RPA, robotic software that can automate tasks people don't have the time or desire to complete. Just like physical robots have replaced repetitive tasks in the manufacturing sector, RPA can help alleviate the tedious day-to-day grind in the office, like form completion, data entry, and compliance record keeping.  UiPath's platform has some notable competition. Microsoft\u00a0is a player in this field, as it seemingly is in all niches of the software realm, but other names include Pegasystems, Blue Prism, and Automation Anywhere. Low-code software development platform Appian\u00a0bought its way into the RPA space at the beginning of 2020 as well. \u00a0 But UiPath is the leader for a reason. Its software bots are available via subscription and can be deployed across legacy IT systems or set loose on the cloud. It makes use of computer vision -- the same AI system that Tesla and other automakers are utilizing in autonomous vehicle and advanced safety features -- to help its software bots  see  what's on a computer screen and intuitively get work done with minimal human input. UiPath says its total addressable market is currently worth $60 billion a year and going strong, which isn't farfetched if businesses continue to struggle hiring and staying up to date in the cloud era. RPA is entering the workforce, and robotic engineers (the software developers that train bots) are quickly becoming top human employees to help implement needed automation.  UiPath had an impressive first quarter of 2021 as a result of this demand for increased workflow automation. Revenue increased 65% year over year to $186 million. On an annualized basis, revenue was up 64% to $653 million. Free cash flow in Q1 was negative $20.1 million, but that is mostly by design as the company spends heavily on development of new RPA capabilities and on marketing. This will be a profitable company sooner rather than later, though. Gross profit margin on services rendered was at 74% in the quarter -- and is historically even higher than that (89% last year), but new product rollouts are dragging down the average for now until they get more customers and reach a more profitable scale.  This automation leader can afford to expand aggressively, too. It ended April 2021 with nearly $1.9 billion in cash and equivalents and zero debt, over four years' worth of operating expenses (when excluding non-cash stock-based compensation to employees) at the Q1 annualized run rate. The payoff could be huge. UiPath expects annual recurring revenue (ARR) to be at least $850 million by the end of this year, 30% higher than what it was in Q1 and 47% higher than last year.  But this growth comes at a steep premium. UiPath's market cap is at $35.5 billion as of this writing, valuing the company at over 41 times management's guidance for ARR this year. Is it worth the price tag? Clearly only if UiPath's current momentum is sustainable for at least a few more years -- and if it swings to profitability at some point. It has the potential to do so. The software industry is massive, and UiPath's current ARR is only around 1% of its immediate addressable market. Plus RPA is becoming a flexible option businesses can employ to automate a wide range of processes in their operations. If effects of the pandemic are here to stay (and I think they are), UiPath may just be getting started. \u00a0 But here's what I wouldn't advise: Don't go loading up on a ton of this stock. Keep your position (if you buy one at all) very small when starting out. When I make my first buy, it will likely be less than 0.5% of my total portfolio. With such a sky-high premium, UiPath is already priced to perfection, and this is no social media-hyped meme stock headed to the moon. I plan to just dip a toe in first and brace for some possible turbulence. That can be expected with high-growth, high-premium stocks, especially within the first couple of years after an IPO. But at the very least keep this RPA leader on your radar.

At the end of 2020, there were 10 million electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, on roads worldwide. By comparison, there were a mere 35,000 fuel cell electric vehicles globally at the end of last year.  Yet, hydrogen fuel cells offer a few advantages over batteries, and can potentially be far more useful in some areas such as marine, heavy-duty vehicles, and certain stationary applications. Besides, both Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) and ChargePoint Holdings (NYSE:CHPT) will need a lot more than sectoral tailwinds to succeed. Let's see which of the two companies has better long-term prospects. Plug Power's hydrogen fuel cells find varying applications. They can be used in forklifts, as a backup power source, and in hydrogen-powered vehicles. More than 90% of the company's revenue right now comes from its materials handling segment, which provides fuel cells for use in forklifts. The company is focusing on expanding into the electric vehicles market and has formed partnerships with automaker Renault and Korea's SK Group to this end. Image source: Getty Images. ChargePoint is an EV charging company with a network of more than 112,000 charging stations in North America and Europe. It is a leader in EV charging in North America, where it generates more than 90% of its revenue. ChargePoint's market share in North America in the level 2 chargers -- which can charge for a range of 100 miles in around four to five hours -- is more than 70%. The company also offers fast chargers. ChargePoint was founded in 2007, though it got listed, through a special purpose acquisition vehicle, in February this year. Plug Power expects to report first-quarter gross billing of $70 million, a 60% year-over-year growth. It has provided annual gross billing guidance of $475 million for 2021. Plug Power is yet to report its first-quarter results. The company reported a net loss of $39 million in the third quarter last year, before plunging to a net loss of $476 million in the fourth quarter, due to the effects of certain warrants.\u00a0 Image source: Getty Images. ChargePoint generated revenue of $40.5 million in Q1 and expects to generate $195 million to $205 million in revenue for its fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2022. ChargePoint too is taking losses and reported a net loss of $39.4 million in the first quarter.  ChargePoint expects to achieve EBITDA breakeven in 2024, when it hopes to generate around $86 million in adjusted EBITDA. In comparison, Plug Power expects to generate $250 million in adjusted EBITDA in 2024. Both companies are yet to prove that they can carry out their operations profitably. Based on their past financial performance and guidance, both Plug Power and ChargePoint seem to be in the same boat. However, there are a couple of factors that make ChargePoint look better. First, it doesn't have a history of failing to meet guidance numbers like Plug Power. Second, it has not been diluting existing shareholders for years, as Plug Power had been doing. Finally, with battery electric vehicles leading the growth in the low-carbon environment-friendly vehicles segment, the prospects for ChargePoint seem better than those for Plug Power. The company's model of growth focused on commercial customers, instead of one based on selling electricity, should support its EBITDA goals. Having said that, a major chunk of growth in EV charging could go to home or private chargers. Furthermore, there is competition from other charging networks as well as from automakers like Tesla, which have their own charging infrastructure. So, the road to profitability for ChargePoint won't be an easy one either.

Over the very long term, the stock market has averaged an annual return, with dividend reinvestment, of about 7%. That may not sound like much, but that return will double your money once a decade. In other words, you'd have a 15-fold increase in your initial investment in 40 years. But for many young investors, stocks have been an afterthought, thanks in part to the rise of cryptocurrencies. In particular, they can't stop chirping about the so-called  people's currency,  Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE). Image source: Getty Images. Dogecoin is popular with retail investors for a variety of reasons. It's nominally cheap to buy, has been getting plenty of love and meme action from Tesla\u00a0CEO Elon Musk, and more businesses than ever are accepting it as a form of payment. Investors in Dogecoin believe they're getting in near the ground floor of a future global currency. However, none of these statements are entirely accurate or tell the full story. Sure, Dogecoin is nominally cheap at $0.38 per token compared to Bitcoin at close to $38,000 per coin. But this comparison doesn't factor in the 130 billion Dogecoin that'll be in circulation within a few weeks. Every year, mining activity brings approximately 5.2 billion new Dogecoin into the circulating supply. This 4% inflation in 2021 might not sound like much to worry about, but it's been a long time since the actual inflation level hit 4% in the U.S. Translation: Dogecoin is a pretty poor inflation hedge. Enthusiasts are also making exaggerated statements when it comes to the adoption of the people's currency. First off, Dogecoin's blockchain is handling only 50,000 transactions daily, per BitInfoCharts.com. To put this into some context, it would take in excess of 38 years at 50,000 transactions a day for Dogecoin to handle the same number of transactions payment processors Visa\u00a0and Mastercard\u00a0handle on a combined basis in one day. It's also only accepted by approximately 1,300 businesses, which demonstrates what little utility it has beyond crypto exchanges. Even Musk is a liability for Dogecoin. Let's not forget that Musk was all-in on Bitcoin just a few months ago, and even allowed consumers to buy Tesla electric vehicles with Bitcoin. Less than 50 days after enacting this policy, he changed his mind, with concerns about the adverse environmental impact of Bitcoin mining influencing his decision. The full story is that Dogecoin is a terrible investment. Instead of buying into what's clearly become a hype-driven asset with virtually no fundamental catalysts, you'd be better off ditching Dogecoin for stocks with tangible growth outlooks. The following trio of stocks are all screaming buys in June, and they'd fit the bill perfectly. Image source: Getty Images. Most folks think of growth stocks and value stocks as being independent of one another. In reality, some companies can offer both high growth and deep-discount value. That's the case with clinical-stage biotech stock Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX). The biggest catalyst currently in Novavax's sails is experimental coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine treatment NVX-CoV2373. This vaccine, whose scientific name just rolls off the tongue, delivered impressive efficacy in a large-scale phase 3 trial in the U.K. As a whole, NVX-CoV2373 demonstrated 96.4% efficacy against the original strain of the virus and 86.3% efficacy against the prominent U.K. variant. The only reason Novavax hasn't gone to the moon on such exceptional results is its numerous delays. The company had been forecasting a second-quarter emergency use authorization filing in the U.S., U.K., and Europe, but it's been pushed back to the third quarter. There's also concern about Novavax's ability to produce a meaningful amount of vaccines prior to the fourth quarter. There's obvious worry that Novavax could miss the high-margin, low-hanging fruit in key developed markets. But this thesis misses a major point: There are around 7.9 billion people in the world, and only a small portion of them have been vaccinated against COVID-19. Even if Novavax is only a smaller player in developed countries in the beginning, its potential in emerging markets and as a booster vaccine player in developed countries could allow it to rake in billions annually. Novavax is sitting on $2 billion in cash and has a forward price-to-earnings ratio, per Wall Street's consensus, of just six. It's a dirt cheap growth stock that's screaming to be bought. Image source: Getty Images. Another screaming buy that could run circles around Dogecoin is gold and silver mining stock First Majestic Silver (NYSE:AG). Though precious-metal miners have underperformed the broader market in recent years, mining stocks look to be hitting the sweet spot in their growth cycle. From a precious metals standpoint, things couldn't be better. The global economy recovering from a pandemic-based recession should boost demand in a big way for silver, which is where First Majestic expects to generate approximately 57% of its revenue this year. Meanwhile, gold continues to catch favorable headwinds from historically low lending rates and the prospect of higher inflation at some point in the future. In short, First Majestic should benefit from higher average realized selling prices. But there's more to like here than just higher gold and silver prices. First Majestic Silver has four operating mines and four projects in the pipeline, all of which are slated to increase its silver equivalent ounce (SEO) production over time, and which may well lower the company's all-in sustaining costs. The San Dimas mine continues to be the superstar, with the installation of a new high intensity grinding mill expected to further boost production. But don't overlook the La Encantada silver mine, which will see a significant increase in output once the Ermitano project begins yielding results in 2022.\u00a0 In short, First Majestic Silver's operating cash flow is about to explode higher. Image source: Getty Images. The biotech industry is also home to a third screaming buy in June: Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX). What makes Vertex special is the company's focus, and success, in treating patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is a genetic disease characterized by thick mucus production that obstructs the lungs and pancreas. It currently has no cure, but Vertex has developed and had the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approve multiple generations of treatments designed to improve lung function. Vertex's latest treatment is combination therapy Trikafta. Following a phase 3 study which saw Trikafta improve forced expiratory volume by 3.7 percentage points in one second, the FDA gave Vertex's lead drug the green light five months ahead of its scheduled review date. Since it targets the most common CF mutation (the one 90% of CF patients have), it's expected to eventually bring in $6 billion in annual sales.\u00a0 Because Vertex has been so resoundingly successful at developing treatments for CF, it's been able to build up a mammoth war chest. The company ended March with $6.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents. That's capital it'll use to fund the internal development of a dozen compounds, as well as make acquisitions.\u00a0 Instead of gambling on a subpar digital currency, you should strongly consider ditching Dogecoin for the highly profitable Vertex.

Over the past four decades, the benchmark S&P 500 has navigated its way through Black Monday in 1987, the dot-com bubble, the Great Recession, and more recently the coronavirus crash. Despite these drawn out and in some cases abrupt swoons, the average annual total return of the S&P 500, including dividends paid, is 11% over four decades. However, this long-term buy-and-hold thesis has been put to the test in recent years by the rise of cryptocurrencies. In particular, there's an immense amount of buzz surrounding meme-based digital currency Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE), which has risen by more than 100,000% since December 2013. Image source: Getty Images. The so-called  people's currency  is lauded for its nominally low price point of $0.32 per token, as well as the perception that current investors are getting in near the ground floor, well before broad-based adoption. Enthusiasts also point to Tesla\u00a0CEO Elon Musk's unwavering support of Dogecoin as a positive. While these catalysts might sound great on paper, they're often lacking in a big way if you dig below the surface-scratching social media hype. For example, coin price isn't everything. Dogecoin might sound nominally inexpensive at $0.32, but it overlooks that practically 130 billion tokens are outstanding. This circulating supply is growing by approximately 5.2 billion tokens each year. This constant mining-based inflation modestly dilutes existing Dogecoin holders. A much bigger issue can be seen on the utility front. Enthusiasts would like to believe they're getting in on the ground floor, but only an estimated 1,400 businesses are accepting Dogecoin worldwide, according to online business director Cryptwerk. Worse yet, it's taken eight years simply to reach a meager 1,400 businesses. Dogecoin's blockchain isn't particularly efficient, either. While it does boast lower transaction fees than the Big Two of crypto (Bitcoin\u00a0and Ethereum), there are a number of other crypto competitors that offer considerably lower transaction fees. Dogecoin also takes around 20 minutes to validate and settle transactions, which is longer than other popular cryptos. It could also be argued that Elon Musk is more of a liability than a positive catalyst. Musk's about-face on Bitcoin should serve as a warning for Dogecoin enthusiasts. The simple fact that a meme tweeted out by Musk can move Dogecoin by 30% or more is a pretty clear indication that hype, not tangible catalysts, are driving this bus. The thing about hype train is that is always eventually derails. Instead of putting your money to work in a highly speculative digital currency with virtually no real-world catalysts, my suggestion would be to buy stocks that offer tangible long-term growth potential. The following trio of top-notch stocks could all make you a boatload of money. Image source: Getty Images. Just as you shouldn't let Dogecoin's nominally low token price fool you into thinking it's in any way cheap, you shouldn't allow robotic-assisted surgical system developer Intuitive Surgical's (NASDAQ:ISRG) $864 share price convince you that it's pricey. Over time, Intuitive Surgical has all the tools (literally and metaphorically speaking) to make its shareholders rich. Intuitive Surgical has been manufacturing and selling its da Vinci surgical system to hospitals and surgical centers for two decades. These systems allow for more precise incisions, compared to laparoscopic surgery, which can in turn lead to shorter hospital stays and fewer complications. Since 2000, more than 6,100 da Vinci systems have been installed worldwide, which is far more than any of its competitors on a combined basis. This suggests Intuitive Surgical's market share dominance in robotic-assisted surgery is likely insurmountable. What's more, Intuitive Surgical's operating model is built in such a way that operating margins improve over time, which should lead to earnings growth outpacing sales growth throughout this decade. In its early years, selling its pricey da Vinci system made up the bulk of its revenue. But given that these systems are intricate and complex, the margins associated with selling these systems wasn't great. Nowadays, the bulk of the company's revenue comes from selling instruments and accessories with each procedure, as well as from servicing its da Vinci systems. These are considerably higher-margin operating segments. As the base of installed da Vinci surgical systems grows, the percentage of revenue derived from these higher-margin channels increases, too. There's also plenty of opportunity for the company to expand its surgical focus. Da Vinci is a mainstay in urology and gynecology procedures, but can still gain abundant share in thoracic, colorectal, and general soft tissue procedures. For all of these reasons, it's a company that can maintain a double-digit growth rate for a long time to come. Image source: Getty Images. Another growth stock that can make patient investors a boatload of money is cloud-based ad technology company PubMatic (NASDAQ:PUBM). People are consuming content from connected TV (CTV), over-the-top (OTT) media (i.e., media services offered via internet), and mobile in greater amounts. PubMatic aims to help publishers via real-time programmatic advertising transactions. Its cloud-based infrastructure can cover multiple ad platforms and devices, and it's exceptionally transparent from a price perspective. In other words, it's helping advertisers put their money to work in the most efficient way(s) possible. During the first quarter, the company processed 18.5 trillion impressions (that was up 106% from the prior-year period), with a net dollar-based retention rate of 130%. In English, this means existing publishers spent 30% more in Q1 2021 than they did in the prior-year quarter (Q1 2020). While adding new publishers is helpful and essential, the bulk of future cash flow growth is going to come from existing clients spending more.\u00a0 Just as impressive, mobile and omnichannel video (OTT/CTV) sales jumped 83% from the prior-year period and accounted for 63% of sales. Revenue growth was so robust in these segments that the company upped its full-year sales forecast range by $15 million on the low and high end to $195 million to $200 million. PubMatic finds itself at the center of the fastest-growing trends within the advertising space. This should give it a good chance to make its shareholders a boatload of money. Image source: Getty Images. A third top-notch stock that can run circles around Dogecoin and make investors filthy rich is Singapore-based Sea Limited (NYSE:SE). That's because Sea has a trio of rapidly growing operating segments. For the time being, the company's gaming division is generating all of its positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Sea ended March with almost 649 million quarterly active users (QAU). But the far more impressive figure is that close to 80 million of these gamers were paying customers. Most gaming companies see a low single-digit percentage of gamers pay to play. In Sea's case, 12.3% of its QAUs are paying, up from 8.9% in the first quarter of 2020. Looking further out, the company's e-commerce platform, Shopee, is far more exciting. Shopee has been an increasingly popular shopping destination for folks in Southeastern Asia and Brazil. By targeting regions with a burgeoning middle class, Sea has seen orders surge. In the March-ended quarter, gross orders were up 153% to 1.1 billion, with gross merchandise value effectively doubling to $12.6 billion. Shopee could help Sea double its revenue every two years throughout the decade. Lastly, Sea's nascent digital financial services segment is making waves. Total mobile wallet payments topped $3.4 billion in the first quarter, with the company counting over 26 million paying users. Since some of the regions Sea is targeting are underbanked, digital wallets could provide a financial services workaround for consumers.\u00a0 Suffice it to say, it offers a far more compelling long-term outlook than Dogecoin.

", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/10/is-tencent-stock-a-buy/", "date": "Thu, 10 Jun 2021 12:30:00 GMT", "content": "With investors chasing the latest meme stock, cryptocurrency, or new IPO or SPAC, large-cap tech stocks like Tencent (OTC:TCEHY) may seem like yesterday's news. In fact, you may not have noticed, but Tencent's stock has corrected more than 20% of its 2021 highs. The sell-off doesn't appear to be due to anything wrong with Tencent's business, but rather outside factors such as inflation fears, growing U.S.-China tensions, and the ongoing anti-monopoly crackdown in China.\u00a0 Yet with a strong, diverse, and growing business, along with a lower stock price, Tencent looks like a solid value at today's prices, as the above concerns appear baked into its stock price. Tencent remains a pillar of the Chinese tech economy. Image source: Getty Images. In the first quarter of 2021, Tencent reported good revenue and profit growth. While some may quibble with a deceleration in its core online games business and slight margin compression, the company turned in an otherwise solid quarter: Tencent Q1 Results Q1 Growth (YOY)  % of Q1 Revenue Value-added services (VAS) 16% 53.5% Online advertising 23% 16.1% Fintech and business services 47% 28.8% Total revenue 25% 100% Non-IFRS operating income 20% 32% Data source: Tencent Q1 2021 earnings release. YOY = year over year.\u00a0  While the core video game segment, which is part of VAS, decelerated to 17%, it also had a tough comparison to the year-ago quarter, during which China was almost entirely in lockdown. Fortunately, the company's fintech and business services segment, which contains Tencent's electronic payments and cloud computing services, picked up the slack. Cloud deployments in China had actually been hampered by the pandemic, and Tencent is gunning to be a winner in this high-growth market, so that growth was great to see.\u00a0 There are a number of reasons Tencent might have sold off on otherwise solid results. First, some investors anticipate fines from China's market regulator. The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) passed stricter anti-monopoly laws in February. Although those laws mainly target online e-commerce platforms, Tencent has significant stakes in various large e-commerce players that may be subject to regulations and/or fines. And while Tencent itself has managed to sidestep a lot of the pitfalls rival Alibaba\u00a0has stepped into, it could still be the subject of fines, specifically for its data and algorithm usage to tip things in its favor. Second, Tencent also said it would be stepping up its investments in a big way this year, which will lower its margin in 2021. Although operating profit will likely still grow, that growth will be somewhere between flat growth and the 22% growth logged last quarter, according to management. While management maintains these new investments in cloud, high-end video games, and short-form video are due to large growth opportunities, some may see it as a sign of intensifying competition. Tencent also said it would contribute RMB50 billion (roughly $7.8 billion) to a social equity fund, with the payoff being uncertain for shareholders. That social equity fund may be a pre-emptive move to please government regulators, so it's an open question as to whether there will be a return on this investment in the future.  More than any other large-cap technology company, Tencent has utilized its ample cash flows to invest in other high-growth technology businesses. By taking significant minority stakes in winning companies, from Pinduoduo\u00a0in China to Sea Limited\u00a0in Southeast Asia to Tesla\u00a0in the U.S., Tencent's growing equity investee portfolio exceeded RMB1,362 billion, or just over $213 billion, as of March 31.  Assuming that figure has remained flat, then Tencent's $741 billion market cap is really about $528 billion for its core business. Tencent's net income attributable to equity holders was about $5 billion last quarter, about a $20 billion run rate, and that run rate, though muted by investments, should still grow throughout the year.  So Tencent's value outside of its investment portfolio is about 26 times its current earnings run rate. That seems fairly cheap for a company that sees large growth opportunities ahead, and which can also funnel its cash flows into a high-growth venture-capital-like portfolio. While the regulatory concerns are valid, remember that Tencent bounced back strongly from China's late 2018 halt on video game approvals, which caused Tencent's price to fall during that period as well. Yet over time, game approvals eventually restarted, and Tencent's stock went on to new all-time highs. Basically, Tencent remains a world class company, and long-term oriented investors shouldn't hesitate to take advantage of the current weakness in its shares.

It's hard to give an objective answer to that question, but no matter where you stand on it, it's unquestionable that cryptocurrencies in general -- and Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE) in particular -- need to be a part of that discussion. As cryptocurrencies are increasingly perceived as a hedge against inflation, Dogecoin has skyrocketed in value in the past few months. Nevertheless, the long-term bull case for Dogecoin remains flimsy.\u00a0 For one, it remains a highly volatile asset. And random Tweets from Tesla CEO Elon Musk seem to be a major catalyst for its value to rise or fall, which is a worry in and of itself. Further, according to online business directory Cryptwerk, only about 1,300 businesses accept Dogecoin as payment,\u00a0which is a minuscule fraction of the total number of companies in the U.S. For these reasons (and many more), Dogecoin probably isn't your best bet if you're looking for an asset that can continue to perform well in the long run. Instead, it's best to turn to solid businesses with strong growth prospects. Two that fit the bill are Tandem Diabetes Care (NASDAQ:TNDM) and Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV).\u00a0  TNDM data by YCharts Medical devices specialist Tandem Diabetes Care has performed poorly in the stock market year to date. Since the beginning of the year, shares of the healthcare company are down by 8.03%, compared with gains of 12.34% for the S&P 500. Despite this poor showing for its shares, though, Tandem Diabetes's financial results continue to be strong.\u00a0 The company recorded sales of $141 million in the first quarter, 44% higher than the prior-year quarter. As a reminder, Tandem Diabetes makes the bulk of its revenue from the sale of its t:slim X2 insulin pump (and accompanying accessories), an innovative product for managing insulin-dependent diabetes. In the first quarter ending March 31, shipments of its crown jewel grew by 46% to 25,352.\u00a0 Tandem Diabetes isn't profitable yet, but its net loss per share shrunk to $0.08 during the first quarter, compared with $0.25 during the year-ago period. At least two factors could continue to fuel Tandem Diabetes' growth for many years to come. First, there is the unfortunate increase in the world's population of patients with diabetes. In the U.S. alone, about one in three people will have diabetes by 2050, according to some estimates.\u00a0Only 10% had diabetes in the country as of 2018, and only 0.93% did in 1958. Image Source: Getty Images. The need for products capable of making the lives of diabetes patients a bit easier won't subside anytime soon -- quite the contrary. Second, Tandem Diabetes continues to innovate. A major step forward for its t:slim X2 insulin pump was the clearance of its Control-IQ Technology by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) back in 2019. Control-IQ Technology is a feature that allows the t:slim X2 insulin pump to be used in conjunction with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) Systems such as Dexcom's G6.\u00a0When paired together, these two devices help diabetes patients keep their glucose levels within a desired range. The process is automated thanks to Tandem Diabetes' Control-IQ Technology feature. Tandem Diabetes recently reported results from a study that showed the use of the t:slim X2 insulin pump with Control-IQ Technology leads to improved time in range (the amount of time a person with diabetes spends within the target blood sugar level) for patients. The healthcare company is always looking to add new features to its products, and it is also working on newer, better insulin pumps. And with an underpenetrated addressable market in the U.S. and abroad, the company can still grow by leaps and bounds. Don't be fooled by its recent struggles in the market -- this healthcare stock still has many great days ahead. Now is as good a time as any to initiate a position. Veeva Systems is primarily a tech company; it provides cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) solutions to drugmakers and other players in the life sciences industry. The services Veeva Systems offers are in high demand for many reasons, one of which is that developing products in the life sciences industry is a legal and logistical nightmare. Veeva Systems' suite of offerings helps life science companies efficiently navigate these challenges while ensuring legal compliance. One way to gauge how happy the company's customers are with its products is by looking at the retention rates for its subscription services -- which make up the bulk of its revenue. During its past three fiscal years, the company had retention rates between 121% and 124%. Another way to gauge the success of Veeva Systems is by looking at the company's revenue growth. Veeva Systems' quarterly top line has increased by 230.1% over the past five years.\u00a0Veeva Systems' latest quarterly update was also impressive. In its Q1 2022, which ended April 30, the company reported revenue of $433.6 million, a 29% increase over the year-ago period. Earnings per share (EPS) climbed to $0.71, up from the $0.54 reported during the comparable period of the previous fiscal year. Veeva Systems can keep growing for many years to come. For one, the company is always working on newer and better products. Just last year, it introduced MyVeeva, a tool to speed up the clinical trial process for pharmaceutical companies. And that's just one of the more recent offerings in its arsenal. Also, Veeva Systems has been expanding into other industries in recent years, including consumer packaged goods (CPG), chemicals, and cosmetics. All three of these segments share one key similarity with the life science industry: they are highly regulated. Veeva Systems is looking to replicate the success it has already had with its entry into these industries. With a total addressable market worth at least $12 billion,\u00a0the company shows no sign of hitting a brick wall anytime soon. All these factors make Veeva Systems an excellent stock to buy today.

Even a few that began as a joke are now being valued in billions, like Dogecoin (market cap of $42 billion). For those who can stomach their heavy volatility and high risk, some of these digital currencies may hold great promise as investments. But what they don't yet offer is a demonstrated history of usefulness and value in our lives or to the economy. If you are looking for an investment that is innovative, but with a bit more demonstrated potential than crypto, you may want to instead check out the electric and autonomous vehicle spaces. Three potential investment ideas in this space that look favorable right now are Ford (NYSE:F), Chargepoint (NYSE:CHPT), and the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF\u00a0(NASDAQ:DRIV). Image source: Getty Images. With new CEO Jim Farley leading the way since October, Ford's focus is on becoming a leaner, more efficient company with a stronger supply chain that can be a leader in the electric vehicle (EV) revolution, from cars to battery cell technology and manufacturing. This plan includes developing more zero-emissions capable vehicles, and a target for 40% of global sales to come from electric vehicles by 2030. It also aims for all passenger vehicles it sells in Europe to be fully electric by that year. Farley labeled 2021 as a  year of action,  and the company has gotten it off to a good start. Revenue in the first quarter rose 6%, while warranty expenses fell by $400 million. The revenue jump was driven by a shift toward higher-margin vehicles and improved pricing, generating transaction prices $1,900 higher per unit than the industry average. So far, investors are showing their belief in what some might call a turnaround for Ford. With a stock price hovering around a six-year high at $16 a share and the highest analyst price target of $18 well within sight, action is trending in the right direction. Ford's stock hasn't touched $18 in over a decade. Shares are already up almost 74% year to date, and up 126% since Farley took over. In the past six months, the company has made available electric versions of its iconic Mustang, its F-series trucks (the top-selling vehicles in the U.S. for the last 39 years), and introduced the return of the Bronco SUV line (including an electric model) -- slated for deliveries this summer. It also recently revealed a new smaller pickup, the Maverick.  Investors might want to be a bit cautious due to penalties Ford may have to pay in the future. The automaker is currently fighting in court against a Justice Department finding that some years ago it imported what it called passenger vans, but which were actually cargo vans. The vehicles, assembled in Turkey, were marketed and sold in the U.S. as two-person cargo vans. But the automaker made them look like passenger vans by placing cheap, easily removable rear seats in them, simply for the purpose of avoiding the much higher tariffs the U.S. imposes on cargo vans. Ford could wind up paying a penalty of between $650 million to $1.3 billion. But that shouldn't impact the broad strategy the company has in place for growth. As the number of EVs rises, so will the need for charging stations. The International Energy Agency forecasts that by 2030, the number of EVs on the road worldwide will reach 145 million, and with increased government support for sustainability efforts, it estimates that figure could reach 230 million.  Chargepoint is a leader in the EV charging space. With 13 years of experience behind it, it touts 60% of Fortune 50 companies among its 5,000 customers. The company has over 18,000 locations spread across North America and Europe, supported by an easy-to-use mobile app that displays real-time availability information for charging locations. \u00a0 In its fiscal 2022 first quarter, which ended April 30, revenue increased 24% year over year to $40 million. For its fiscal second quarter, it forecasts a top-line range of $46 million to $51 million, and full-year guidance for $200 million at the midpoint. And with a $610 million cash balance as of the end of its fiscal Q1, Chargepoint looks set up nicely for the long term. A lower-risk approach to investing in the electric and self-driving vehicle markets would be to put your money into a larger, more diverse field of companies through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). The Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF offers investors a concentrated focus in these areas, but doesn't restrict itself to automakers or charging station players. The exchange-traded fund mixes key tech suppliers such as NVIDIA, Microsoft, Apple, and Blackberry in among the likes of Ford, General Motors, and Tesla, giving investors exposure to niches such as artificial intelligence for navigation and infotainment, and IoT data analysis. Currently, information technology stocks make up 32% of ETF's holdings, while consumer discretionary stocks account for 34%. As of the end of the first quarter, the ETF's annualized returns have averaged 23% since its inception in 2018. Year to date, it has returned 10.7%. By comparison, the S&P 500 Automobiles and Components Index is down 2% year to date, while the broad S&P 500 has delivered a return of 12.9%.  Experts expect that the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage will continue to impact the EV market for up to six more months, but the world is still in the early stages of this EV boom. The market is expected to grow rapidly over the next five to six years to an estimated value of $802 billion by 2027. That would amount to a 400% climb from 2019's level. For investors who are looking for long-term portfolio holdings, and who have the patience and the stomach to handle short-term volatility along the way, all three of these options could turn out to be big winners. \u00a0  "}, {"source": "Motley Fool", "title": "Dump Dogecoin and Buy These 3 Top Growth Stocks Instead ", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/10/dump-dogecoin-and-buy-these-3-top-growth-stocks-in/", "date": "Thu, 10 Jun 2021 11:11:00 GMT", "content": "Investing in Dogecoin is a risky venture. In the past month, the cryptocurrency has lost more than 40% of its value while the S&P 500 has been flat. And while a tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk ( the Dogefather ) could quickly reverse that path, that unpredictability is what makes it an untenable investment for the long term, even if you are willing to stomach a moderate level of risk.\u00a0 Rather than gambling on Dogecoin, investors are better off going with stocks with much more solid growth paths. Buying shares of\u00a0GrowGeneration\u00a0(NASDAQ:GRWG), Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE), and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) will likely prove to be much safer options over the long haul, and you'll still come away with some strong returns. Image source: Getty Images. Hydroponics and gardening company GrowGeneration has been an exceptional investment over the past year, rising more than 560% in value during that time and outperforming the S&P 500 and its 32% by a wide margin. What's exciting about the stock is that it likely hasn't peaked. Hydroponics can make growing crops more efficient by using pipes and pumps that occupy less space than conventional gardening methods. And that can be particularly useful in the cannabis industry, where both individuals and licensed producers can benefit from the practice. GrowGeneration could play a pivotal role in the burgeoning industry's long-term growth. In its first-quarter results for the period ended March 31 (released May 12), sales of $90 million were up 173% year over year. Its comparable-store sales were up an incredible 51%. The outlook is so strong for the business that GrowGeneration is updating its guidance for the year, now projecting its full-year revenue to come in between $450 million and $470 million. When the company issued its fourth-quarter numbers back in March, it was forecasting sales of no more than $430 million for 2021.  With more states passing marijuana legislation (including potentially hot markets like New York and New Jersey), there could soon be an influx of demand for GrowGeneration's products. Even given its impressive gains thus far, GrowGeneration looks poised for greater returns in the years ahead. Tech company Adobe has always been a solid long-term buy. In the past year, its shares are up 31%, are in line with the S&P 500. What makes the stock an attractive growth investment is the consistency that it offers. In each of its past five fiscal years, the company has generated a profit margin of 20% or better. That's important for investors because it means that for every dollar in revenue the company generates, $0.20 of it is going straight to the bottom line. And Adobe has done just fine growing revenue. For the three-month period ended March 5, the company's sales of $3.9 billion were up 26% year over year. With subscription revenue accounting for more than 90% of its top line, that gives the business lots of stability. Users also benefit, because they don't need to spend hundreds of dollars on expensive standalone software from the company and can just subscribe to it as they need it.\u00a0 Strong branding is key to keeping customers coming back and buying products and services. And Adobe's brand has been synonymous with quality. That, along with strong margins, makes the stock ideal to buy and hold for many years. Starbucks is another company that enjoys a strong brand, with consumers continually flocking to its stores despite the availability of cheaper coffee elsewhere. Although the pandemic has adversely impacted the business due to lockdowns and restrictions (sales were down more than 11% in fiscal 2020), the company has been reemerging and getting back to growing its operations. On April 27, it released its second-quarter numbers for the period ended March 28. Comparable-store sales in China were up 91% year over year, while in the U.S. they rose by 9%. The company is also seeing consumers spend more across the globe; the average ticket size worldwide is up 19%. And like Adobe, repeat business is a big part of why the company is successful. As of the end of Q2, Starbucks' loyalty program had just under 23 million active rewards members in the U.S., up 18% from a year ago. These are all positive signs that the company's recovery is well under way. Prior to the pandemic, the business was growing at a slow but stable rate: In fiscal 2019, its sales rose by 7.2% to $27 billion, and the year before that they grew by 10.4%.\u00a0 Now that the economy is opening back up in many places and more people are able to resume their normal day-to-day activities, the business should be able to continue building on its recent results, which could make the stock an even better buy in the near term. In the past 12 months, shares of Starbucks have increased by 35%.

Even though stocks don't outperform bonds or commodities every year, they've delivered the highest average annual total returns over the very long run. However, this thesis has been put to the test over the past decade by the rise of cryptocurrencies. For instance, Bitcoin\u00a0has generated a triple-digit average annual return over the past decade. But it's not Bitcoin that's entranced retail investors. That honor goes to the so-called  people's currency,  Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE). Image source: Getty Images. Investors are typically excited about Dogecoin for three key reasons: The problem is that if you actually take the time to dig into these catalysts, you'll find more holes than you would in a slice of Swiss cheese. For example, while Dogecoin is nominally inexpensive, it's anything but  cheap  if we factor in the nearly 130 billion Dogecoin in circulation. Block rewards courtesy of mining activity -- crypto miners use high-powered computers to solve complex equations that validate transactions as true -- are creating about 5.2 billion new Dogecoin a year. In 2021, we're talking about inflation of just over 4%. That may not sound like much, but it's been well over a decade since the actual inflation rate in the U.S. has been higher than 4%. This means Dogecoin does a poor job of providing a hedge against inflation in the United States. There are also a number of holes in the bull thesis that Dogecoin's adoption is growing: And don't even get me started on Elon Musk's tweets and memes being able to create and destroy billions in market value in the crypto space. The stark reality is that Dogecoin is a poor investment and almost certainly a pump-and-dump scheme in action. Instead of putting your money to work in this ticking time bomb, my suggestion would be to forget about Dogecoin altogether and invest in great companies that can make you a millionaire. The following trio of stocks fits the bill perfectly. Image source: Getty Images. First up is technology-focused real estate company Redfin (NASDAQ:RDFN), which has all the tools needed to make millionaires out of its shareholders. The real estate industry is stodgy, and Redfin is looking to shake things up in two ways. To begin with, it's aiming to save its customers a boatload of money. Traditional real estate firms take up to a 3% commission/listing fee when you buy or sell a home. Redfin's listing fees range between 1% and 1.5%, depending on how much business you've done with the company. Considering how home prices are soaring in the wake of historically low lending rates, the amount of money Redfin can save buyers and sellers is being magnified with each passing day. Aside from cost-savings, Redfin is also aiming to disrupt the real estate industry by personalizing and/or simplifying the buying and selling process as much as possible. For instance, it's introduced the RedfinNow service in a handful of cities. RedfinNow allows the company to purchase homes from sellers for cash, which removes the hassles homeowners typically deal with when selling their property. There's also Redfin Concierge, which can cost up to 2.5% of a home's selling price. Concierge works with sellers to stage homes or tackle upgrades that'll yield top-dollar from buyers. This combination of cost-savings and personalization has helped Redfin nearly triple its share of U.S. existing home sales since the end of 2015 (0.44% in Q4 2015 to 1.14% in Q2 2021). This is likely just the tip of the iceberg. Image source: Getty Images. Another millionaire-maker stock is The Original BARK Company (NYSE:BARK), which you might know best as dog-focused products and services company BarkBox. BARK officially completed its merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Northern Star Acquisition earlier this month. Let's start by stating the obvious: never... ever... bet against the companion animal industry. Since 1988, the percentage of U.S. households that owns a pet rose from 56% to 67%. What's more, year-over-year spending on U.S. pet expenditures hasn't declined in well over a quarter of a century. This year alone, almost $110 billion will be spent on our furry friends, according to estimates from the American Pet Products Association. Translation: People love their pets, and they'll pay big bucks to ensure their well-being and happiness. BARK provides that happiness via monthly subscriptions. The company's core offering delivers toys and treats each month to owners. As of the latest quarter, BarkBox had approximately 1.2 million subscribers (up 91% year-over-year), and the S-1 from last year noted a record-high retention rate among these subscribers. Keep in mind that since this is a subscription-driven model, BARK is basking in gross margin of around 60%. Similar to Redfin, innovation is also a key driver. Last year, BarkBox introduced Bark Home and Bark Eats. The former provides basic-need accessories like leashes, beds, and collars, whereas the latter works with owners to develop and deliver a high-quality dry food plan. Despite company expectations that sales will nearly double by 2023, BARK remains one of the cheapest pet stocks relative to its sales. This discount likely won't last much longer. Image source: Getty Images. A third stock that offers greater long-term prospects than Dogecoin and can make investors millionaires is Esports and gaming company Skillz (NYSE:SKLZ). Why Skillz? Instead of going head-to-head with big-name gaming developers, Skillz chose the highly profitable middleman route. It's developed a platform that allows gaming enthusiasts to compete against one another for cash prizes. In turn, Skillz and the developer(s) of the games being played keep a cut of the cash prize. Since it's a lot easier to maintain a gaming medium than to develop new games, Skillz boasts an impressive gross margin of 95%. Even though Skillz is still losing quite a bit of money as it ramps up marketing for its platform and its headcount, the initial gaming data is highly favorable. At the end of March, 17% of its gamers (467,000 people) were paying to play. That's at least eightfold higher than the industry average of 1.6% to 2% of gamers who pay to play.\u00a0 Investors will also want to keep a close eye on the multiyear agreement Skillz signed with the National Football League (NFL) in early February. Football is the unquestioned most-popular sport in the United States. If developers can find the end zone even a couple of times with NFL-themed games, this partnership with the NFL could really put Skillz on the map.

A full transcript follows the video.   This video was recorded on May 28, 2021. Chris Hill: We got the latest headlines from Wall Street, we'll get a report on the automotive industry from veteran journalist Paul Lienert. As always, we have got a couple of stocks on our radar but we begin with another deal in the media landscape. This week, Amazon bought MGM Studios for $8.5 billion. MGM was founded nearly a century ago, and the studio library includes 17,000 TV shows and more than 4,000 films, including the James Bond and Rocky Balboa franchises. Jason, pretty much everyone thinks that Amazon overpaid for MGM. [laughs] Let's face it. They need the content and they've got the money. Jason Moser: Yes, and yes. They do need the content and they do have the money and I agree. Probably it's easy to look at this deal and at least in the near term and feel like maybe they overpaid, but also, I feel like as much as we love Disney for their vast catalog of IP, this to me is an investment on that same wavelength. What I'm getting at here is that while it looks like today, they're paying an awful lot for content that may or may not pan out in the near term. It also does give them, I think, a really long tail of opportunity in taking this content, taking this IP in a number of different directions, backstories. Doing all of that stuff that Disney does so well with all of its IP, making new stories out of content that they already have, this gives the Amazon at least the potential to do that, which I think is encouraging. Then the other side of this deal, it's not like they're going to get access to everything. I mean, licensing video content is an involved affair and it's difficult to always connect all the dots. While you might not see all of this content immediately making its way to Amazon's distribution, I think what it does do it, giving Amazon ownership of it, even though you may see that content on other channels, it at least gives Amazon the opportunity to monetize it to some extent. I just think this requires looking a little bit further out than probably many would like to. Ron Gross: I think that's where you get into the valuation. When you look at the fact that they don't have total control or ownership over a lot of the content back from I think pre-1986, perhaps it was the day then 007, James Bond, has very tight restrictions on it from two folks who own really control of it. That's where you look at it and say, well, this has been shopped around for a while, Apple, Comcast, folks looked at this at significantly cheaper prices and passed. Yes, Amazon has the money. Yes, it probably won't matter if they overpaid, but you still want a company, a CEO that has fiscal discipline. I think based on the fact that they don't have total control and total ownership, they appear to have overpaid. Hill: Let's get through some earnings, and we'll start with Costco. Third quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected, same-store sales grew nearly 16%. The shares of Costco, basically flat this week, Ron, where is the respect? Gross: I like this report, but it's not perfect. There were certainly some bright spots and Costco continues to be just a wonderfully run company, but it wasn't perfect. Revenue was strong up 21%, as you said, comp sales greater than 15%, e-commerce up 38%. The renewal rates from the membership business which is basically their whole model, very strong still at 88%. That's actually 0.1% lower, but that's because China kicked into the calculation now and China is new, and memberships tend to not renew at the same rates as ones that have been around for a while. There was strength in the non-food business. They saw strength in travel from pent-up demand from COVID as the vaccines rollout. People are getting back to traveling. There was pressure from supply delays, higher freight costs, ship shortages. I think we're going to see that consistently as we have been across retailers, as well as inflationary pressure, we're going to see, that's going to be a common theme. Items containing paper, plastic, metal. These things are seeing relatively significant price increases. Management says that although gross margins were a bit weak, inflation did not have a big impact on gross margins yet. Let's keep an eye on that. Adjusted income up 20%, that's strong. They are beginning a phased return of food sampling. I think we like this. The food courts are coming back. They are optimistic about sustained demand for their higher-margin items, jewelry, home furnishings. They showed some confidence by raising the dividend 12% back in April. Costco continues to operate very well. It just, things are not perfect and investors at 36 times earnings want to see something a little bit more robust to get excited about the stock. Hill: First quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected for salesforce.com. The business software giant also issued higher guidance than Wall Street was expecting. Shares of Salesforce up more than 6% on Friday, Jason. Moser: Yes, strong quarter. Salesforce is a funny one, because it's this massive market leader in customer relationship management. That CRM market that we talk about. But when you try to pinpoint exactly what Salesforce does, it's difficult to do it, and that's precisely what makes it so darn strong though. It's in a line of work with a lot of moving parts and Salesforce does a lot of things really well, but just understanding what CRM is, I think helps. CRM is about data, it's systems that compile data from different communication channels, including the Company's website, telephone, email, live chat, marketing materials, and even social media now, so that ultimately allows businesses to learn more about their target audiences and how to cater to their needs. That's where Salesforce does really well. It's just difficult to really fully understand how they do it but it's a collection of a lot of really great tools and acquisitions. I mean, they've acquired Newell Software along the way, Tableau. Now Slack, which should close later on in this quarter. All things put together, the sum of the parts here is really impressive that translates into the numbers. I mean, revenue of close to $6 billion, that was up 20%, excluding currency effects, operating cash flow $3.23 billion dollars, up 74% from a year ago. They raised revenue guidance like you mentioned to $26 billion for the year. They are gunning for $450 billion in revenue for fiscal 2026. The scary part is I totally believe that they can get there. When you put all of that together with its market-leading position, it's a company right now that is valued at around 37 times free cash flow. That to me seems totally reasonable for such dormant businesses, one that investors really should keep on the radar. Hill: Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods up nearly 20% this week after same-store sales in the first quarter doubled expectations and profits tripled expectations, Ron. Whatever CEO, Lauren Hobart, and her team are doing at Dick's Sporting Goods appears to be working quite well. Gross: This is a true blow-out quarter. As you said, the metrics are just wild. Net sales of 119% from last year's first quarter, and they also included a metric from two years ago to help people understand the impacts of COVID which a lot of retailers are doing now and I like that. If you look back at 2019, sales are up 52% compared to 2019, so really strong even when you remove the impact of COVID. Same-store sales up 115% as the anniversary of the majority of store closures. Let's take that into account when we see these crazy high numbers, last year was not a normal year as we all know. E-commerce up 14%. That's grown from 13% of net sales in the first quarter of 2019 to 20% now. I think we will continue to see that ramp up. Strong consumer demand across golf, outdoor activities, home fitness, activewear. These are rebound in their team sports business as youth sports get back to business. They admitted that they benefited from stimulus checks as many retailers have. Gross margins widened and as you said, earnings-per-share just skyrocketed up 511% from the first quarter of 2019 and was actually higher than all of 2019. Really strong, focused on tech, omnibusiness, omnichannel distribution, introducing Dick's house of sport in Rochester, New York. That's their first one. Focusing on the Golf Galaxy business as they see renewed strength in golf, raise their earnings-per-share guidance for 2021. This is a really strong quarter. Hill: Not to add to the pressure on them, Ron, but you have to figure with summer camps opening up the potential for fall sports, returning to normal. You've got to believe that the next few months present a good opportunity for them as well. Gross: I think this continues and the stock is not expensive at, I want to say like 11 or 12 times earnings right here and if they continue to put up these numbers and they continue with strong omnichannel, I think this is a good one to look at. Hill: Okta's results in the first quarter took a back seat to the announcements the company made. The cybersecurity business said their loss for the current quarter is going to be bigger than originally thought and that CFO, Michael Kourey, is leaving immediately. Jason, they named an interim CFO while they looked for a replacement but the one-two punch of guidance and Kourey leaving had shares of Okta down nearly 10% this week. Moser: I do understand the market's reaction. It was a good quarter. There are some questions, of course, that come up when the CFO of the year steps down after a major acquisition. Just not really a good look but with that said, I do see actually a tremendous opportunity for this business in the coming years. If you consider the trends that are really driving Okta's business today, it's the deployment of Cloud in hybrid, it is digital transformation, it is the adoption of Zero Trust security. Maybe Zero Trust is something we're going to hear more and more about here in the coming years. The Biden administration, for example, issued an executive order here recently in regard to our national cybersecurity posture, ultimately saying that Zero Trust is going to be a requirement for government agencies for one. We've seen Zero Trust all over other organizations as well. That's just going to be something that continues to be more and more important. I think it's tailwinds for Okta's business that will, I think, help them recover from this OK. If you look at the numbers, the revenue for the quarter, they're up 37% over the year, and subscription revenue up 38%. This is primarily a subscription business too, which is great. To me, again, you look at the dollar-based net retention rate there, it remains strong in the 120% range. That Auth0 deal just closed. Perhaps it was just time for the CFO to move on. I don't know. There wasn't a whole lot of light shared on the call but again, given the tailwinds and the importance of cybersecurity, I think that Okta is doing a lot of things to remain relevant in that space, and with the stock value today, it's 35 times sales. It's like all of these other high fliers but again, I think this is a business that I think they're doing something that really matters here. It's certainly one to keep on the radar for investors. Hill: First quarter profits for Ulta Beauty were more than double what Wall Street was expecting. The cosmetics retailer also raised guidance for the full fiscal year. Shares of Ulta up nearly 10% this week, Ron. Gross: Yeah, last quarter with Mary Dillon the CFO, she leaves behind a very strong company that puts up a really nice quarter beating expectations. Sales up 65%, driven by the reopening of the economy, of course, consumer confidence again, government stimulus checks, as we'll see across retail. Comp sales of 66%, driven by a 52% increase in transactions and an almost 9% increase in the average ticket. We'll come back down to earth and compare numbers to fiscal 2019. We saw sales increase 11% over 2019 and comp-store sales increased 7% over 2019. Still strong, obviously not as strong as when you compare it to the pandemic months. Mid-teen growth in e-commerce on top of last year's 100% growth, you have sales penetration now in the mid-20% of sales, gross and operating margins widened significantly. They've increased loyalty members by 1.7 million members in the first quarter. That's 2% lower than the first quarter of last year, but 5% higher than Q4. The member base continues to recover from the pandemic. I think we'll see that and we'll get back to growth mode. They're on track to open the first Ulta Beauty shops at Target later this summer. Net income, $230 million versus a loss this time last year and they're repurchasing stock. New CEO takes over, Dave Kimbell, former Chief Merchandising Officer, company increased guidance. I think this bodes well for at least the next several quarters, if not the next couple of years. Hill: On last week's show, Andy Cross's radar stock was Autodesk. The design engineering software company came out with first quarter results on Thursday. Jason, shares of Autodesk up a bit this week. What stood out in their report for you? Moser: Yeah, this is just a really strong business that's poised to become even stronger. I think particularly with the tailwinds of this massive infrastructure spending that's currently being deliberated here in DC, we're talking about tailwinds with a company like Okta. There are tailwinds here with a company like Autodesk too. When you look at what they're trying to build, it's a very comprehensive offering. I think that's something that's really working well for them. Just look at construction, for example. The architecture, engineering, and construction side of the business. They have this vision to connect all of the phases of construction with end-to-end cloud-based solutions that essentially take it from the planning and design to the construction operations and maintenance. To that end, the architecture, engineering, and construction segment grew 16% for the quarter. That was the top performer and it's the biggest part of the business so it matters. They grew the top line overall 11% excluding currency effects. Operating margin was flat. Earnings per share up 20% from a year ago. Subscription revenue, again, just a lovely subscription business model here, that's 96% of total revenue. That's just reliable too, which is really nice. For fiscal 22, they raised full-year revenue guidance up to a range of 4.3% to 4.35 billion shares today valued at around 60 times full-year earnings. Listen, we got a cash flow positive and profitable business. Gross: Yeah, let's try to be happy with that. Moser: It's not valued at 60 times sales. This is times earnings. I would encourage investors to focus on that. As a shareholder myself, I remain very pleased with what Autodesk is doing and I think it's only going to become a more relevant business here in the coming years. Hill: Shares of Williams-Sonoma up 4% this week after a monster first quarter report. Profits came in 300% higher than a year ago, same-store sales were up 40%. They raised guidance. Ron, is it possible shares of Williams-Sonoma should have been up more of this week? Gross: Perhaps because they crushed estimates, left them in the dust. I don't know what the analysts were thinking when they put forth their estimates but they were way off. You hit some of the highlights. 40% comp growth, strength across all brands, which is important because sometimes we see weakness in some of their brands. Obviously, reopening acceleration across the country is helping all of the brands. We can go through them. West Elm, up 50%, Pottery Barn, 41%, Williams-Sonoma, 35, and Pottery Barn Kids and Teen up almost 28%. They have a couple of emerging brands. Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham combined those delivered comp growth of over 35%. The global business was up over 81% now, approximating about a $100 million business. Gross and operating margins widened really significantly. That's where we saw that compound into that huge adjusted earnings-per-share growth of almost 300% that you noted. As you said, they raised full-year outlook from mid to high single digit revenue growth to low double digit to mid-teen revenue growth, and year-over-year operating margin expansion, which again, both those things will compound to strong earnings-per-share growth. They intend to close 25% of their stores over the next five years as e-commerce continues to ramp, stock looks pretty good with only 15 times earnings. Hill: Between the unveiling of its new electric truck and announcements made at its Investor Day event earlier this week, Ford Motor is the talk of the automotive industry. Here to share insights on that as well as the latest with Tesla self-driving cars and more, is veteran journalist, Paul Lienert. He covers automotive tech, innovation, strategy, and finance for Thomson Reuters. Paul, thanks so much for being here. Paul Lienert: Chris, been a while since we talked. Glad to chat. Hill: Lots to catch up on. I want to get to the new F-150 in a minute. But Ford Motor made a lot of announcements at the event they had on Wednesday. They are investing $30 billion in electric vehicles over the next four years. They expect by 2030, they're going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% of their sales are going to be electric vehicles. I know you were covering the event. What is the biggest headline coming out of the event in terms of your thinking? Lienert: Probably the biggest headline that I've seen involves either the $30 billion set of plans to spend through 2025 on electrifying its vehicles or that 40% of its global vehicle sales by 2030 will be EV. By the way, that includes 100% in Europe which it's already committed to. I think maybe a more important headline that I didn't see very many places was Ford CEO Jim Farley focusing, refocusing, and intentionally focusing on the commercial vehicle market. In Ford, I wouldn't say own side market, but boy, they have a stranglehold on it right now. That was part of its strategy with the electric F-150 was to aim it at commercial customers who are already heavy-duty buyers of the standard F-150, including some pretty fancy versions of it. Hill: You and I have talked over the years about the leaders in this industry, CEOs like Elon Musk and Mary Barra, Alan Mulally. What is your take on Jim Farley? What should people know about him? Because I've just started to read a little bit about him. He seems like a very focused person. Lienert: I've known Jim for a long time. I've known Jim since he was a young product planner at Toyota. He is a really smart guy. He knows cars inside out. He knows the car business inside out. He's a big thinker. Because I've had a running discussion with a friend of mine who's in the venture of the capital business the last couple of days about Ford, about Farley in particular. My friend was talking about Jim Hackett, who is Farley's immediate predecessor. I will tell you as much as I admire Jim Hackett and like some of his thinking. I think he found it difficult to articulate a plan or a vision or a strategy for Ford, in the wake of Alan Mulally, who did such a wonderful job of all of those things. I think with Jim Farley, Ford Motor Company now has a guy who has a vision, he's got a strategy, and he can articulate those and guess what? Wall Street loves it right now. Ford stock has shot up this week. To frame that, $30 billion that it's spending on electrification, its market cap is approaching $60 billion. Ford is talking essentially over the next four to five years, spending about half the value of the entire company on EVs. Hill: Earlier this month they unveiled the F-150 Lightning, an all-electric truck. It's going to hit the road next spring. They've got more than 40,000 reservations for this thing in less than two days. What do you think of the truck and what does this do for Ford's business? Lienert: You know what, Chris. They were really clever on a couple of fronts. They made the Lightning looking awful lot like the existing F-150, which has been America's best selling vehicle for more than three decades. So that's not a dumb thing. No. 2, it didn't do it from the ground up. At first, you had to wonder, why didn't they do that? Well, there were two huge reasons. One, it was a lot less expensive, but two, it gets them into the market a lot quicker. The Chevy Silverado EV, for instance, probably won't hit the street for maybe six to nine months after the Lightning does. Hill: When are you going to get your hands on one of these things? I want to know what it feels like to be behind the wheel. Because I think the challenge with something like this is, as you said, this is an incredibly popular vehicle that they are modeling this after. The people that they are hoping are going to buy it are going to make the obvious comparison to the existing F-150. It has a lot to live up to, doesn't it? Lienert: Well, it does and particularly with the work truck market. I mean, these are people who depend on these trucks for their jobs. That's a whole different market from, say the market at GM's aiming the Hummer EV at. At a price that's considerably less than the Hummer EV is going to come in at. These are fussy people, Ford knows what they need because it has an ongoing and very successful commercial vehicle business. It's equipped with the Lightning with the things that work truck owners want. We were laughing the other day when we were counting the number of power outlets on the Lightning. I want to say there were 10 or 11 of them and a friend of mine said,  Oh, my gosh, power outlets, it's going to be the new cup holders.  Hill: For all of the success that Tesla has had over the past decade, I think it's fair to say that the unveiling they had last year with their truck didn't go as well as they would have liked. What do you think they are thinking as they watch the F-150 Lightning get the attention that it's getting? What is your take on the state of Tesla these days? Lienert: Tesla and Elon Musk are the source of constant conversation at my place, both at home and at work. I say I have a great deal of admiration and respect for Elon Musk and for his company. They have been in the vanguard pretty much for the last 10 years, the vanguard of vehicle electrification. I think there's still there with some of the advanced battery work they're doing. Elon blew people away with the Cybertruck. I'm anxious to see what the production version looks like and get in it and get a feel for it. There was a lot of teasing and you know how irreverent Elon can be. Under his subjects there was a lot of teasing for it a year ago. I give him credit this week, he sent out what it sounded like a very sincere congratulatory message to Ford for putting that truck out on the street. It's going to be really interesting. I suspect the audience for the Cybertruck is completely and totally different from the audience for the F-150 Lightning. Hill: This is a space where there can be more than one winner, it sounds like. Lienert: For now, the space has been pretty rock solid. It's worth several million vehicles a year in the United States. The F-150 alone sells somewhere around 900,000 vehicles a year. There is likely room for more and particularly for different and the Cybertruck is surely different, not just in looks, but the fact that it's all-electric. We will see, I think, the market for pure electric pickups, whether we're talking the Lightning, the Hummer, the Cybertruck, is untapped. None of the companies know. Everybody's being a little cautious, maybe Tesla less so than the other guys. We're going to see how many buyers are actually out there and how soon the market gets saturated if in fact it does get saturated. Hill: Earlier this week, The New York Times had a piece entitled The Costly Pursuit of Self-Driving Cars. I'm curious where you think we are right now with self-driving cars because you and I have been talking for nearly a decade and it seems like I don't want to say we're as far as we've ever been away from the self-driving cars. Well, we're nearly a decade into this conversation and you look at a business like Waymo, you got the people from Google [Alphabet] working on this and they're still having the types of problems that nearly a decade ago we thought we'd be further than we are in this process. Lienert: Correct on all points, Chris. I might point out, Google probably has dropped something like $10 billion just in its own pursuit of self-driving cars. I have a little bit of a different take on this. If you're talking about passenger cars only and whether it's robotaxis or self-driving cars that you and I might one day be able to buy. That is still probably as far away from reality as it was two or three years ago. I would say we're realizing we're probably 90% of the way there and the last 10% is insane. It's going to be ridiculously expensive. It's going to take a ridiculous amount of time, way longer than anybody thought. The flip side of that and this is something that we learned, I think during the pandemic is that perhaps the real market or the more immediate market is for self-driving trucks. I'm thinking specifically about commercial delivery vehicles. Anything from small shuttles that we've seen occasionally around to big over-the-road trucks. I am beginning to believe that self-driving trucks are going to hit the highways in increasing numbers long before we see many robotaxis on the road. Do you know why? I forgot the biggest reason is it's a revenue generator. Probably bigger revenue generators than robotaxis. Hill: That's as good a reason as any to put your emphasis on where the money can be made. The biggest company out there is Apple and they've got the deepest pockets. Apple has blown hot and cold when it comes to the automotive industry. There are times over the past decade where it really seemed like they were working furiously behind the scenes to develop their version of a vehicle. Then you haven't heard anything for six months, 12 months. Is Apple going to enter the automotive market in the next five years? Lienert: I'll answer that without trying to sound slide. They are in the automotive market right now, but in a different way, I think, than you're talking about. The question is whether they really will do the car that has been designed and shelved and redesigned and still does not have a green light as far as we know. We've talked to people who have worked for Apple. We've talked to people who have bid on various Apple projects involving the Apple Car. We have a good deal of intel out there about it and what they're thinking and how they're thinking. The current thinking has been a smallish electric car that's self-driving. Apple's assembled a pretty formidable team with talent in all these various areas including batteries and self-driving software and technology sensors. They're getting close to being ready to go, if and when Tim Cook ever decides to push that button. They know full well, simply from watching the experiences of Google and General Motors and Volkswagen and others, just how expensive a proposition is. Money isn't necessarily the object here. I think Apple's long game, Tim Cook long game, is not to sell cars, but it's to leverage the data it thinks it can get from those cars. Here's the rub, I think there's a good argument to be made that Apple can make perhaps nearly as much money from the data it's already begun harvesting from the devices we take in the cars and now it's beginning to get itself embedded in dashboards. If Apple can do more deals with more car companies to get itself more deeply embedded in dashboards, does it really need to do a car to make the kind of money it's made, for instance, off iPhone apps? Yeah, they make money on iPhones, but man do they make a lot of money on the apps too don't they. Hill: They sure do. Last thing and then I'll let you go. I know you've been focused on Ford Motor this week because of their event but what's one more thing in the automotive world that you're keeping your eyes on throughout 2021. Paul Lienert: I'm so glad you asked me that, Chris. I am captivated by the work that's going on, much of it behind the scenes and a lot it in the auto industry on aerial vehicles, electric, vertical take-off and landing vehicles, planes if you will, that are neither a conventional aircraft nor a helicopter but these things are being looked at for everything from hauling passengers to hauling cargo. It's going to be fun to see where GM and Toyota and other companies go with that and how soon they put them on the market. Hill: It's one more reason I like talking to you, Paul, you managed to sell that without using the phrase flying cars.\u00a0 Lienert: I was waiting for you. Hill: If you want to know more about the automotive industry, it's pretty simple. Read Paul Lienert's stuff. Paul, it's been a busy week for you so I appreciate the time. Thanks for being here. Paul Lienert: You're too kind. Thank you, Chris, take care. Good to talk. Hill: Before we get to the radar stocks, a reminder, as always. If you are looking for more stock ideas, more recommendations, check out Stock Advisor. It is the flagship service here at The Motley Fool. You get stock recommendations every month, Best Buys Now and a lot more. Just go to radarstocks.fool.com. You get a 50% discount, not because it's memorial day weekend, it's not one of those sales. It's just because you are one of our dozens of listeners, that's why. Gross: Awesome. Hill: Jason Moser, you're up first. What are you looking at this week? Moser: Yeah, digging into a new one for me. The company is called Elastic (NYSE:ESTC), ticker is ESTC. They provide software and services that enable users, or in this case, businesses to search through structured and unstructured data just to try to come up with what all that data ultimately means. Search for consumers, Google's got that nailed. The search for businesses, it's a little bit of a different value proposition there. That's what Elastic's focused on. Very nice subscription model that accounts for better than 90% of their revenue. Just recorded recently, 13,800 subscription customers, that is compared to 5,000 in 2018. That tells me that maybe they are doing something right. They see a total addressable market at $78 billion today for a company that generated $500 million in trailing 12-month revenue. Seems like there may be some opportunity on the horizon for the company and therefore investors. Hill: Dan Boyd, our man behind the glass, do you have a question about Elastic? Dan Boyd: Not really a question, Chris, more of a comment here. Jason's a smart guy and he brings great stocks to this show every week, week-in, week-out. You could depend on him. This Elastic company, probably a great company. But when I heard the word Elastic, I didn't think about Software-as-a-Service. I think about gym shorts, socks, not Software-as-a-Service. Moser: I'm right there with you, Dan. You got to dig a little bit deeper. Hill: Sounds like an implicit questioning of the brand. Ron Gross, what are you looking at this week? Gross: I'm looking at the Toro Co (NYSE:TTC), TTC, a recent recommendation in our Total Income service. They design and manufacture professional and residential landscaping equipment. They're a leader in the residential professional landscaping market, solid track record growth, and market outperformance. They're making acquisitions, interestingly, in robotics and AI. They're tapping into the opportunity to shift the industry toward autonomous systems. Near-term tailwinds include 5G infrastructure investments that should bolster sales of equipment. They've increased their dividend for the last 17 years. We like that in Total Income. Current yields are just under 1%. Hill: Dan, question about Toro? Boyd: Absolutely. Well, not really a question. More of a comment again. Sorry, everyone. Last year I had to buy a new lawnmower because my old one had broken. I went to consumer reports to look at what the best lawnmower company is, and Toro was ranked as the highest. Gross: Nice. Boyd: For like a couple of years in a row also, but then I did a little more research and I realized that Toro, on their push mowers, uses Honda motors. I cut out a couple hundred dollars from my purchase and just bought a Honda instead with the same motor. Maybe not the same [...] of Toro, but a couple of extra hundred dollars cheaper and the same grass-cutting power. Gross: A shrewd purchase, Dan. I can't argue with good shopping.\u00a0 Hill: What do you want to add to your watch list, Dan? Boyd: You know what, Chris, just because I saved a couple hundred dollars, doesn't mean it's not a good company. I'm going with Toro. Gross: Nice. Hill: Jason Moser, Ron Gross, guys, thanks for being here. Gross: Thank you. Moser: Thanks. Hill: That's going to do it for this week's Motley Fool Money. The show is mixed by Dan Boyd, our producer is Mac Greer. I'm Chris Hill. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week.

To catch full episodes of all The Motley Fool's free podcasts, check out our podcast center. To get started investing, check out our quick-start guide to investing in stocks. A full transcript follows the video.   This video was recorded on June 4, 2021. Dylan Lewis: It's Friday, April 4th, [it was actually June 4] and we're talking about the industry powering the digital revolution. I'm your host Dylan Lewis, and you're actually not going to be hearing much from me today. We put out a lot of content here at The Fool. Every now and then I'll hear a conversation and think, this is darn good. We've got to get this in front of as many people as possible. On today's show, we're going to be airing a conversation between analysts John Rotonti and Jason Hall breaking down the semiconductor industry. It originated in our Discovery Now premium live stream and then later made its way into Motley Fool Live, our U.S. member live stream. It's a fantastic overview of the industry, the shortage that's been collecting headlines, and why this space is full of so many stellar businesses. Think of it as a little sneak peak for non-members and a reminder for all of our members that there are some awesome conversations happening over at live.fool.com. Without any further ado, enjoy. [...] Jason Hall: So before we talk about our show today, which is going to be focused on the semiconductor industry and what's going on there, I think it'd be great if you could just spend a couple of minutes talking about what you do for The Fool and what you enjoy the most about the things that you do. John Rotonti: Thank you, Jason. Yes. I'm a senior analyst. I've been at The Fool for seven years now and I'm the head of investor training and development. In that role I teach a lot of classes to our new analysts, that's one thing I do. In that role I also serve as a resource across our investment team. So if any member of our investing team is looking for an article or even maybe some WallStreet research on a particular company, or a model on a company, I may be able to help them with that. Third thing I do is I bring in outside guest speakers, practitioners, academics, all superstars in their fields and their area of expertise to come speak to our team internally, teach us classes, lead discussions. Sometimes I bring in a group of outside speakers and we host a round-table of panels and we get to watch these three or four amazing professional money managers have a discussion with each other for an hour and a half. That's how I spend my time as a coach. Then I'm the co-host of the morning show on Motley Fool Live, and the host of My Investing Life on Motley Fool Live, and then I'm experimenting with another show called Tech30, where I bring in some guests and interview them for 30 minutes and talk about tech and innovation. Hall: Awesome. Well, there's no doubt that tech and innovation is the old software city in the world. The bottom line is that every company that's not using technology in their business is going to lose to their biggest competitor who is. Rotonti: Exactly. Hall: So that's awesome. Well, John, again, thank you so much for coming on. I can tell you that every member, whether they have listened to you talk about companies that you follow, or back when you were working on some of the premium services and providing the analysis that led to recommendations, every single member has benefited from you because of your influence on so many of the other analysts and helping out with coaching and training. For every single member I want to extend a thank you to you for that. Rotonti: Thank you, Jason. Hall: Onto today's show we have a fun topic lined up. One of the [...] and it's in the consequences that's happened recently, that's had all kinds of far-reaching implications across all kinds of industries is the semiconductor shortage, right? Whether it was coming out of COVID and the impact on global supply chain, natural disasters, fires, booming economy, surging demands, the proliferation of semiconductors across so many more different types of products and over. It's an amazing, interesting industry that's in a bit of a disarray in terms of meeting supply, but has so many implications that investors need to understand. John, tell us what we need to know. Rotonti: Yeah, Jason. Regarding the shortage, you hit on most of the big ones. The biggest reason there's a semiconductor shortage right now, I think, is because of the digital acceleration that was brought on by COVID and the subsequent economic lockdown. Digital everything and the cloud was growing really fast before the pandemic, but the pandemic accelerated that growth, and those industries whether it's software, whether it's hardware, whatever it is in the digital space relies on semiconductors. When the digital transformation gets accelerated, literally by years, down into months the semiconductor manufacturers are already operating at full capacity or near full capacity and it takes time to ramp up semiconductor manufacturing. So that's a big thing. The industry was not ready for this accelerated digital transformation. You mentioned natural disasters. One major semiconductor fabrication facility was shut down by a fire, another by the decrease in taxes. Then a third thing I'll say is coming out of recessions or the economic shocks it's not uncommon to have supply constraints. It just so happened this time the supply constraint is showing up in semiconductors because of the digital acceleration we talked about and how important semiconductors are to everything digital. Hall: It's a confluence of events. There are so many things that have occurred all at the same time that have made what was going to be a tight supply situation even worse. You hit on something that I think is really important to understand and talk about bringing these facilities up to scale and adding more capacity. I think we've all gotten spoiled when we see CrowdStrike report earnings or Zoom report earnings or Shopify, where their revenues are up 50% or 100% from period to period. When you're dealing with software or Software-as-a-Service or something on the Cloud, you can scale up very quickly, but when you think about building foundry for semiconductors and a lot of times they're very specialized, right? Making sure that you are building out the right capacity for the rights need can be really critical. It does take time. It's very time-intensive, very labor-intensive, very energy-intensive, and then there's all the logistics of this. Yeah, it's very power-intensive. But then you have the logistics too of the inputs, your feedstocks that you need, and then getting the product out and then getting a distributor to where it needs to go. It's about as old schools as it gets. Rotonti: It takes years to build and $10 billion to $20 billion to build one modern-day advance node semiconductor manufacturing foundry. Hall: So the one that comes to mind most immediately on that actual company that we're not really going to talk much about, but that's Intel. This is one of the companies that have earmarked these massive worth $30 billion or so to add capacity. Maybe it's more than that, but to build out more capacity in North America. Rotonti: Yes. If you look at the three largest semiconductor manufacturing companies, Taiwan Semi (NYSE:TSM), I guess we should call them foundry. They're more accurately called foundries or fabrication facilities. But Taiwan Semi has announced they're going to spend $100 billion in CapEx over the next three years, $100 billion, Samsung that is going to spend over $100 billion over the next several years without specifying what several years means, and then you just said Intel. I thought it was $20 billion to build two fabs in Arizona, but maybe the number has gone up to $30 billion since the last. Hall: No. I think that sounds right. Rotonti: But it's a lot. I mean, it's a lot. Just three companies right there you're looking at, well, over $200 billion of industry CapEx in the next few years. That's a lot. Hall: It is. Then they are going to have to be regularly spending additional capital costs to modernize the update just to continue to meet the design expectations. Rotonti: Yep. Taiwan Semi is a leader in this. They are currently the only company globally at scale putting out five-nanometer chips, which is a leading-edge chip right now. They're going to open their first three-nanometer chip sometime in 2022. That's the timeline they've announced so far. So yeah, they're continuing to move, continuing to progress and innovate to more advanced chips. Hall: Before we get into the specific companies it might be helpful to talk about as you think about the industry and as you think about how the buckets that the industry is within and the companies that participate in what they do, can you break that down for our viewers? Rotonti: I can, for sure. What's remarkable is that at every stage of the semiconductor manufacturing value chain there's two or three and in some cases one global leader. We're really talking about earned oligopoly, earned duopolies, earned monopolies in some cases because as you said it's just so capital and knowledge-intensive that the barriers to entry are so high. If you look at how to make a leading-edge five-nanometer chip, for example, because these leading-edge chips they have billions of transistors on them and the chips are about the size of a stamp or a thumbnail. When I say billions, I mean billions, the Apple and one chip has 16 billion transistors. Amazon grabs a ton of chips and has close to 30 billion transistors, so tens of billions of transistors. You can't just put that together by hand. You need software. The first step is to design the blueprint for that tiny chip. How are you going to fit 20 or 30 billion transistors on it? There's two global leaders in software that do this design. It's called EDA software, Electronic Design Automation software. It's also sometimes referred to as computational design software, two global market share leaders, Cadence Design Systems and Synopsys. This computational design software is highly complicated. It's a mix of matrix algebra, artificial intelligence, advanced geometry, and other fields of math that I can't even pronounce or understand. It's really that complicated. To work as a software engineer in one of these companies you have to have a masters or a PhD. It's not just you take a class in Python or something like that. It's super-advanced. That's the first step, you design a blueprint of what the chip is going to look like on the software to global duopoly. The next step is basically a chip. Chip-making basically has a thousand steps. But you can basically break it down into, you deposit film onto the silicon; onto the wafer and the film is different chemicals. Then you etch away or cut away at that film. Then you wash with water. You repeat that tons of times. It's more complicated than that, but you repeated tons of times. The next step after you make this blueprint with a software, as you do the deposition, you deposit these layers of chemical onto the wafer. There's three companies that make these deposition machines, Applied Materials, Lam Research, and Tokyo Electron. But in deposition, Applied Materials is the industry leader, once again, an oligopoly, after you have done the deposition, then you take the blueprint that was created with the software and it is shined. You use a light source and you project that blueprint through a mask and through a series of mirrors onto the chip. This mask and this series of mirrors shrink down that blueprint to the size of a chip. How it's done is really magical. There's only one company that provides the light source that is shined through this mask and through these mirrors to shrink the blueprint down onto the chip. That's ASML. It's the only company on earth that has this extreme ultraviolet or EUV lithography. Basically, it's a tiny wavelength of light that is shined through this mask in these mirrors to trace or stencil the pattern onto the silicon wafer. The way it works, people thought it was impossible. Industry experts thought it was impossible but ASML figured it out. A tiny drop of molten tin is hit by carbon dioxide lasers, CO2 lasers, and the lasers vaporize the molten tin. That tin turns into a ball of plasma, shining so bright that it creates this EUV, this extreme ultraviolet light source. The science is so complicated, no other company has been able to figure it out. This process of shining these lasers onto the tin, creating this plasma ball of light happens 50,000 times a second. The reason EUV extreme ultraviolet light is so important is because extreme ultraviolet light has a tiny wavelength of light. Hall: The wavelength. That's how you get smaller and smaller. Rotonti: If you're putting 20 billion transistors on a chip exactly right, those transitions have to be packed really close together. The tracing, the stenciling has to be used with a really small wavelength of light. We've deposited material. There are oligopoly of companies that make those machines. We've done the EUV lithography. There's only one company that makes those machines. They cost about $200 million. Then we have to etch away or carve away at the deposition to lay down the transistors and then to connect those transistors. There's three companies that make those machines. They're called etching machines, same three, Lam Research, Applied Materials, and Tokyo Electron. But in etch, Lam Research is the leader. At each stage of this value chain, you have monopolies, duopolies or oligopolies because these companies are so unique and so important and what they're doing is really bending the laws of physics. It's almost impossible to replicate. Hall: Well, I don't know if you're familiar with Arthur C. Clarke, the science fiction writer. Rotonti: Sure. Hall: -- known for his Clarke's three laws. I think the perfect application of his third law is that,  Any technology that is sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic.  Rotonti: You're exactly right. Industry insiders call this process of making a chip, they call it black magic. It's really complicated. All of this happens by the way, at one other company operating at global oligopoly. All of this takes place at a foundry, at a contract manufacturing facility, and the leader there as Taiwan Semiconductor. The deposition machines, Taiwan Semi buys them. The tech machines Taiwan Semi buys them. The extreme ultraviolet lithography machines from ASML, Taiwan Semi buys them. They spend the CapEx, they buy them, they put them in these massive facilities. Massive facilities are much bigger than a football field and they go through these thousands of steps. It's called a recipe and they make these advanced chips and the process is like magic. Hall: The business model works because if you're Apple or you're Microsoft or you're Ford, any one of these companies that's utilizing semiconductors even if you're designing them yourself, spending the capital to build out a facility to manufacture it yourself is almost nuts. Rotonti: These companies, they're called fabulous because they don't have fabs or fabrication facilities. That's exactly right. They put the CapEx burden onto Taiwan Semi. Hall: Right. Rotonti: It's a mutually exclusive relationship though. Taiwan Semi is getting good economics from this as well. Hall: That's the key. Unless you can produce massive volume for your own consumption, it can be cheaper to be fabulous. To use somebody else as manufacturer because when they operate at scale, the volumes they can produce drives down the per-unit cost, and they can be profitable, producing it for cheaper than you can do it if you did it in-house. Rotonti: That's exactly right. The way that these chips are made when you go from one generation of chips to the next, you start with the recipe. You start with the process of knowledge from the prior generation. To go from a seven-nanometer to five-nanometer, you start with a seven-nanometer and then you tweak it from there. Taiwan Semi has done more of these advanced chips than anybody else. They have more process knowledge than anybody else. Hall: Which is a major competitive advantage. Rotonti: It's a major competitive advantage, Jason and it's really hard for others to catch up because you can't skip steps. Intel is behind now. They have to do a seven-nanometer because they can't figure out how to do five or three without going through that process knowledge and learning those steps as they go. That process knowledge, that IP, the library of recipes that Taiwan Semi and Samsung has built up, and Intel to an extent, it's an amazing competitive advantage. Hall: Now that we've got a baseline of knowledge about the different parts of the industry and the levers that are tied to it, we've already been doing this for about 19 minutes, John, that's amazing. It feels like it's been 19 seconds. This is incredible. If we can spend maybe 10 minutes or so talking about some of the top companies here that you've identified that you like. Rotonti: Two or three of them I've discussed already, so we'll be able to be efficient with the 10 minutes we have. ASML is the only company on earth that has figured out extreme ultraviolet lithography. Hall: Right. Rotonti: Moore's Law says that every two years or so, the number of transistors doubles. The only way to double the number of transistors on a chip if the chip sizes change is to shrink the transistors, and push them closer and closer together and then to build these 3D chips and put them on top of each other. But the only way to do this shrinking is with this really ultraviolet wavelength of light. ASML is really the company that has allowed Moore's Law to continue to progress for so long. ASML has earned a monopoly. It is truly a magical company. They are bending the laws of physics, to catch up with them is going to be really hard. Lam Research I mentioned, then Taiwan Semi, I mentioned. All unique businesses as in my opinion, are as difficult to replicate as any business on earth. I'm not going to say it's impossible, but as difficult to replicate as any business on earth. One we haven't discussed yet is Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). The ticker there is TXN. Once again, back to this theme. It operates in a global oligopoly or duopoly. Texas Instruments is the largest, excuse me, analog semiconductor company in the world. Texas Instruments and the No. 2 runner-up player Analog Devices. They control about 50% of the global market share for analog chips. Texas Instruments has an extremely diverse revenue base because they sell 100,000 different products to 100,000 different customers. They sell more products, their product portfolio, their menu of products is larger than any other semiconductor company on earth, and they sell to more customers than any other company on earth. Hundred thousand products, 100,000 customers, so really diverse revenue. The question I get most often with Texas Instruments is,  Why are they selling these analog chips when everything is going digital and digital is exciting and it's fun.  The reason is because TI is an amazing business, it's run by amazing leadership, and they realize that there's this analog paradox at work. You probably never heard that phrasing before. I don't think you'll read it in WallStreet Research but there's an analog paradox at work, meaning that as the world shifts to digital, the demand for analog grows in tandem. Hall: Yeah. Rotonti: It grows with it because analog chips, they do things like manage the power in your cellphone. Your cellphone is a digital device, but you need analog along with it. There's only a few companies really doing this at scale. Then the other great thing about analog chips, as the rest of the world is tripping over themselves getting into the digital space, analog chips have long life cycles. Texas Instruments is mainly focusing on autos and industrial. Rotonti: The average life cycle for one of their auto chips is seven years. The average life cycle for one of their industrial chips is 10 years. So these chips don't face the risk of technological obsolescence. Hall: When you say life cycle, you mean the period of time from when they manufacture the first one to when they manufacture the last one? Rotonti: Yeah. That's right, or the period of time before that chip goes out of style and it needs to be updated. Hall: Right. As compared to the chips that Apple designs and users, every new iteration of their iPhone has a new processor? Rotonti: They're already coming out with the M2, they came out with the M1 a year ago. That's exactly right. So there's no risk to Moore's Law with Texas Instruments. If they don't sell a chip this quarter, it's got a 10-year life, they'll sell it next quarter or next year at a high-margin. In fact, Texas Instruments is selling chips that were released 30 years ago. So on average, auto chips have about a seven-year life cycle, industrial is about a 10. They're still selling some chips they designed and manufactured 30 years ago. Keywords are manufactured, they're vertically integrated. They do their manufacturing in-house, unlike digital chip companies for the most part, and unlike their competitors. They are the only analog chip company. Only analog chip company, once again, a monopoly when it comes to this. Manufacturing chips using 300-millimeter fabrication, which reduces the cost to manufacture these analog chips by 40%. So they have ultra-low cost manufacturing because they do it in-house. Manufacturing through their in-house manufacturing facilities carries incremental growth margins of 70% to 75%. You see incredible margins, incredible returns on capital from a company like this, and they're the only company manufacturing in-house in their space. Hall: It's good to be the king. I think that's the situation with Texas Instruments. Rotonti: It's exactly right, and because they control their supply chain more than their competitors, given the backdrop we're in right now with the shortage of semiconductors, their customers aren't experiencing as much of a shortage because they control that supply chain. They're vertically integrated. There's some shortage. There's some hotspots, they call them, but for the most part, their customers are getting the chips they need. It's a fantastic business. Hall: Here is an interesting thing. Every single one of these companies has outperformed the S&P 500 over that period. That certainly supports two things. No. 1, the trend, the growth, the tailwind for semiconductors, and it does tend to indicate that the market supports you, John, as saying that these are the leaders in this space. Rotonti: That would hold if you look at the Philadelphia Semiconductor Manufacturing Index and you go back 10 years, it beats the market 10 years. It beats the S&P. My point is it holds going back further, but just looking at the companies that you mentioned today, one of the reasons they beat the index, Jason, is because they weren't trading at these valuations that's some software. Amazing software companies and I love them, but the semiconductor companies weren't trading at the valuation some of these software companies were, so they haven't fallen as much. So if you look at Texas Instruments, Jason, it's down 10% from its 52-week high. Fastly is down 65%. If things aren't falling as much, it helps when it comes to outperformance. Hall: It does. It's also a reminder that to a lesser extent, this asset rotation sell-off that we've seen from some of our more interesting names has still impacted even this industry, even though we know that there's strong demand with. It's an opportunity, I think that's the key. It's predictability and opportunity. Rotonti: The other reason they're outperforming, this is Lam Research, this is from New Constructs. They put out really rigorous calculations of free cash flow and returns on invested capital. Look at Lam Research's returns on invested capital. Going from 2016 to 21% trailing 12-month 54%. The average return on invested capital, which is a measure of profitability and efficiency for the market, is about 12%. This is a company that's generated returns on invested capital of 54%. Hall: So that screams demand, that screams competitive advantage, and that screams amazing economics. Rotonti: Yeah. Hall: Oh, by the way, we're really good at capital allocation. Rotonti: Exactly. You look at free cash flow margins, free cash flow is over sales, 17%, 22%, 20%, 26%. Turning $0.20 of every $1 into free cash flow, pretty impressive. Hall: Yeah, that's incredible. Those are numbers to get excited about. Rotonti: You mentioned the demand, maybe one thing to talk about from a high level, another reason, these stocks and the industry, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is outperforming so well, is the thesis for the industry. There are critical infrastructure components to the digital revolution and everything digital, it's a large and growing market and so you've got the long term tailwind. There's no aspect of the modern digital economy that can function without semiconductors, zero. Cloud, artificial intelligence, machine learning, 5G video games, electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, sensors and wearables, the Internet of Things, automation, robotics, crypto, mining, space travel, there is no aspect of the digital revolution that can exist without semiconductors. I hear a lot of investors say that it's Cloud computing that is powering the digital revolution. Hall: But what's powering Cloud computing? Rotonti: Exactly, Jason, and I would agree with that. The cloud is a game changer, but it's a slight oversimplification because without semis, there's no Cloud. Then you mentioned cyclicality really early. I just want to hit on that really quickly. The industry is cyclical. There's no doubt about it, but much less cyclical than in the past. Three reasons for that. One, now they're growing into everything. The cycles used to be driven by the PC cycle and the smartphone cycle. Now they're in everything, including Cloud data centers and servers and everything. Now they're in everything, that's No. 1. No. 2, there's been several waves of massive consolidation in the industry and we're in one of those waves right now. When an industry consolidates, the remaining players become more rational. Then the third reason, you mentioned earlier, now the OEMs themselves, the largest, most profitable, biggest companies in the world, are designing their own semiconductors. It's a whole new customer base; Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Google [Alphabet], Microsoft, talking about this. They're all designing their own semiconductors now. So now that market opportunity is so much bigger. Hall: Yeah. I think that also changes the capital allocation model, because if you're no longer designing and building it, you're not really thinking about the capital investment you'll have to make to build that new design. It just completely changes the economics. Rotonti: Totally. Then the final thing we touched on when I shared my screen, the fundamentals for semis have been misunderstood for a while. They're being better understood, but I still think they're underappreciated. If you look at a list of the best semiconductor companies and put it up against a list of the best software companies, the corporate fundamentals are every bit as good for the best semiconductor companies as they are for the best software companies. Their profitability and their returns on capital are exceptional. Their growth is not as good as software, but they are definitely growing far above GDP. The most recent downturn in the cycle was 2018 or 2019, the trough margins, so the worst the margins got in the most recent down-cycle, were better than the prior peak markets. Hall: That's a tremendous amount. Rotonti: Due to different industries. Hall: Well, I think another thing that's worth mentioning too, is the way that the industry has changed. It seems like it supports more of the stakeholders in a better way, if you think about it. Rotonti: I think so. Hall: That is an indication that all of those strong economic factors in these businesses and the way that they're operated and the returns that they can generate for investors, seems like it predicts that that should continue to prove to be the case. Rotonti: I would agree with that, Jason. I'm not saying they're not cyclical, but I think that there is less cyclicality than in the past. I think they will generate higher margins and higher returns on capital across a cycle than in the past, and I think over a long period of time, they will, as a group, and especially the best players that we discussed here today, we'll continue to outperform the market. Hall: Well, you heard it right here, ladies and gentlemen. I think it'd be fair to say that a basket of these five great companies and these various parts probably work out pretty well as a good way to invest in semiconductors over the next five to 10 years. Rotonti: I think so. [...] Lewis: Listeners, that does it for this episode of Industry Focus.

David Gardner: Following 27 years picking stocks for Fools worldwide, well, it's not every day or month or year or even decade that I changed my life's work, my focus. It's probably understandable that this month's mailbag, more so than most others, has me reacting to your questions about perspective, about the whys and hows instead of just the whats or the whens. These thoughtful global listeners are so full of their own wisdom. It's quite natural for me to share Foolish perspectives coming in from Singapore, or France, or New Zealand, Dubai, or some place more modest like Alexandria, Virginia, where The Motley Fool is based and where many Fools too live. Perspective, not just one, many. A diverse and enriching set of perspectives, each of which looks to me like a little piece of glass, its own unique hue, its own unique shape. This month's mailbag may be thought of as a stained glass window, one that you could buy from right nearby looking through it or from a far looking at it, this week or perhaps again, a few months or years from now. Perspective, perspectives, only on this week's Rule Breaker Investing. Welcome back to Rule Breaker Investing, I'm David Gardner. Thanks for suffering a Fool gladly again. This week, it is the final week of May of 2021. One of the things I always like to do for our mailbag episodes, which we do when months end, is I like to remind us briefly of where we've been this month with this podcast. You might think it was just all about my transition all the time, but the truth is that we did three podcasts before this one. The first one was on Company Culture Tips Volume 8: The New Normal. The second one was indeed about my announcement, it was called A Road Less Traveled in Ten-and-a-Half Chapters. I started writing it that morning. It was 9,309 words. It turns out that it takes about 61 minutes to read, which was how long the second week of the podcast was A Road Less Traveled, but then last week, back at it again to investing with calculating risk ratings, calculating risks foolishly with Alicia and Maria. It was a very Motley month taken all-in-all with a number of different perspectives. I used that word a few times at the top and I was thinking, how could I not invite in my friend and producer, Rick Engdahl. Because Rick, one of the things I've always appreciated about you, is you're pretty doggone, good photographer. I don't know whether you're a professional or not. I think that I would pay you. Rick, have people paid you for your photography? Rick Engdahl: I try not to take any money from my photography. I enjoy the amateur lifestyle. You will appreciate the Latin roots of amateurs, it's doing the thing that you love the most, and that's more important than making money out of it for me, plus I'm not very good at the business side of things.\u00a0 Gardner: Well, Rick, I think you have a pretty good business mind overall, but I appreciate that point. I will say that if there's ever a hedge shot that we need to refresh for me from one year to the next because I don't ever want to be the guy who has the photo from 2012 and you meet me and it's nine years later and I don't look like that anymore. I like to have it updated every year. Rick, you're always the one who takes my head shots, among many others. But you're out there in the world, you're taking pictures of nature or communities. I see your work sometimes on Twitter. Anyway, this is a way for me to say that I think you get perspective. I think that especially when you think about a photographer who must position him or herself at a certain point, and then decide whether to zoom in or out, how much light is needed, and what is the actual angle and composition, that is a very rich understanding of perspective. I have to admit, I'm not really good at it. I never took a photography course. But you were saying something before we started the show that I really loved. What was that, Rick? Engdahl: Just that these days, it's really difficult to purchase a bad camera. There's so many good cameras out there. Most people have one in their pocket, their phone. We all share these wonderful tools for taking photographs, in this case. The only thing that separates me from you or from the professional photographer or from anybody else is just that, is the perspective, where do you bring that camera? How do you look through it? What is the vision that you're sharing with the world? Perspective is extremely important, I think in that discipline. Gardner: Thank you very much for that word. You're right. In fact, I'm glad we went there at the start of this week's podcast because I think it gives us a good perspective to carry throughout. Thank you for that, Rick.\u00a0 Without further ado, I say we get into this mailbag. Now, traditionally we've led off with some hot takes from Twitter, and I've just got a few this month. The first is from @AuthorUK, he is Owen Lean. Owen, I've been enjoying some of the videos you've been posting onto YouTube. I enjoyed this tweet. This is reacting to our risk ratings podcast. Just last week, you said on the RBI podcast,  Great podcast as always. Hypothetical question: if a company IPOs that specializes in haunted world conquest board games, can we call that a medium risk stock?  Owen, concludes, I'm sorry. Now, I have to admit, when I first read that I didn't fully get it, but there is this 15-second rewind, little button that a lot of us have on those smartphones that Rick just referred to on your podcast interface. Feel free to hit back 15 or back 30. Listen to that one again. Did you? Now, you'll know why Owen concludes, I'm sorry. Two other takes from Twitter are very similar but just reflecting a lot of others. Josh Johnson, @JohnsonJoshJoshua, you wrote,  Congrats on moving on to your next endeavor. Selfishly. I'm sad to see you stepping aside, but that will make the Rule Breaker podcast even more special. Fool on.  Thank you, Josh. Santi, @SantiSketch,  Yesterday's @RBIPodcast,  referring to A Road Less Traveled in Ten-and-a-Half Chapters,  got me teary-eyed, when in fact you're not leaving. What a journey, what a gift of teaching, giving, and sharing that you have. Truly remarkable. I will be sharing this episode with my friends and family. I was deeply touched. Thank you, @DavidGFool.  Well, thank you, @SantiSketch.\u00a0 Thanks to so many Fools, for your notes that I received in the last few weeks. I love hearing each of your stories. We'll certainly be sharing some of those this week. But boy, I couldn't nearly share all that I'd love to share in this month's mailbag because there's just too much and too many good things, and that's a great problem to have. Thank you to each of you and for many other tweets in the past weeks.\u00a0 Rule Breaker mailbag item No. 1 this month. This one comes from [...] writing in from Singapore and thanking me.  Dear, David. My name is [...] from Singapore and yesterday was my birthday when I found out that you will be handing off your stock-picking responsibilities. What terrible birthday news, I thought to myself. I have been a fool since 2017, but luckily changed to a Fool since May of 2020, after discovering your Rule Breaker podcast. Yes, I've listened to every single one of them. In my opinion, you are the most inspiring person for investing for me the right way,  says E.  You've provided perspective, the right Foolish mindset for the long game and taught me to be a part owner of many great companies.  Well, I love hearing that from you. Thank you.  I listened to your conversation with Tom last night.  Now, this is referring to a Motley Fool Live event that my brother Tom and I did talking together about this, about happiness.  I have a question for you. If happiness equals reality divided by expectation,  which is indeed the mathematical equation I threw down in that Motley Fool Live event and one I've talked about in the past, probably on this podcast some before. But I'll say at once more,  If happiness equals reality divided by expectation, do you associate happiness with investing? For example, if a company went up by 10 or 20 times over a long period, does that make you happy? Should we lower our expectations about our companies to make us happier?  That's a fun thought.  Is that contrary to one of your teachings that you were optimistic that stocks will generally go up more than they go down?  which is the expectation and which I admit E. contrasts with the idea that you should keep your expectations low. This now concludes,  Maybe the bigger picture is that we shouldn't tie happiness with stock performance at all because life is much bigger than that. We should save like a pessimist, invest like an optimist, and live a happier Foolish life. Please let me know your thoughts on this. Thank you for all the invaluable teaching, Fool on. \u00a0 Well, I think you put it best right at the end. I love that. Save like a pessimist, invest like an optimist, and live a happier Foolish life. I can't really top that. I think you just provide better wisdom that I could answer with. I love that line. I guess I'll only add that part of what I appreciate you doing there, which I try to do myself, is to see both sides of a story, to see both sides of things. Sometimes I've said to talk out both sides of your math and know that you are doing so because then it reminds me and it shows me that you and I are seeing a fuller perspective and then choosing our golden mean along with Aristotle, somewhere within that continuum, being able to see the left side and the right side of the spectrum. E., I feel as if you just embodied the very wisdom, the perspective that I've tried to have. But in closing on this one, yes, I love happiness equals reality divided by expectations. What it reminds us to do, as fellow humans, is to try to keep our expectations low because your reality might be the same, let's say no matter what, but if you had low expectations, boy, are you happy. You're like, this was so much better than I thought it would be. That I think is probably the best perspective to take as someone investing going forward, not just for years, but for decades. Don't expect too much of yourself or the markets, and you'll probably be pleasantly surprised over and over for a long time. I wish that for all of us.\u00a0 Rule Breaker mailbag item No. 2. This one, well, comes in many forms. I've taken two notes, cobble them together. They're great notes, they're very understandable. I thought, why not have my pal and Motley Fool Chief Investment Officer Andy Cross in to join with me to answer these questions. Andy, great to see you again. Andy Cross: Hey, David, always a great privilege to be on your podcast. Thank you for having me. Gardner: Thank you. This is your, I'm going to say, it's your 27th appearance. I hope it is as good as the first 26. Cross: I hope so. Gardner: Andy, I've got a note in here from Cliff [...], Cliff says,  Hi, David. I read your email about your new focus and wish you all the best.  Well, thank you, Cliff. Again, you can imagine many people besides Cliff saying this, and there's a slightly different version of this, which we'll cover in a minute or two, Andy. But let's start with Cliff here. My question is, and you mentioned this in your podcast, so I hope you will indulge me. Cliff says,  You said you had a team of analysts that pitch stocks, but that you have the final pick. Well, who will do that now, or once you stop focusing on that? Will it be a voting system among the analysts, or is there a lead who will step in to fill your shoes?  Again, thank you for this question, all the best from Cliff [...]. Cliff, there are a few things going on in this question, Andy. One of them is just how things have always worked. Between Rule Breakers and Stock Advisor, they've been a little bit different, so I will speak to that in a sec. Then there's the concept secondly of individual versus team. Let's try to touch both of those bases, and let's start with the first one. I will briefly explain how Rule Breakers and Stock Advisor have worked. Andy, you will come on and explain how they are going to work. Cross: Sounds great. Gardner: We can do this? Let's do it. The way that Stock Advisor as the oldest service of all, has always worked is that for my side of Stock Advisor, I basically try to come up with four or five different ideas in a given month. I send them off to my four or five analysts who come back with research reports. I read through each of the reports and I decide I really like that fourth one. That becomes the next Stock Advisor stock or sometimes I don't like any of them. Good news, I've done the same thing the month before or three years before that, so I have a deep bench, you can think of as a watch list, so I draw that. Sometimes when my analysts come back with four or five, I like three of them, and so I've got good ideas for the future. For Stock Advisor, it's been me saying,  Hey, go out and research these stocks and we'll decide what.  By contrast, Rule Breakers is a team-based service. I've had about five analysts or so including myself, and each month each of us comes up with some of our best ideas. Then I look over those five, and I decide I really like Tim Beyers's recommendation this month and so that becomes the new Rule Breaker. That is the past, that is the prologue, that is the basis of how we've done what we've done. Now, Andy, you as our Chief Investment Officer, have been involved in talking through how we want it to go. I have said, I can give you some ideas, but ultimately I want you and our company to decide how these services should work. I love all my analysts, just like I love all my children. Andy, let's start with Motley Fool's Stock Advisor. What is the process in place for Stock Advisor for my side going forward? Cross: David, before I get into the actual process because we're still working through this and still evolving as you can imagine. I think listeners can imagine, those who know your track record as Stock Advisor and Rule Breakers, we certainly want to do our best to continue the winning ways and continue the philosophy that you have set in both those services, that has won for so many, for so long. It's very important for us that we continue to represent the philosophy that you set up in those services. The beautiful thing, David, is the way that you have worked with so many analysts on those services and we have rotated a lot of analysts over the years during those services including myself at various points early in my career. That's a real win for us because we have that body of knowledge that are familiar with your approach in your services. I will say the team approach is going to be carried out throughout both Stock Advisor and Rule Breakers. Gardner: Okay. Cross: Then we'll get to the decision-making too in a second. But we will be leveraging the analysts that you've worked closely with over the years throughout both Stock Advisor and Rule Breakers and that was very important to us, including to your brother, Tom, as we think about making sure we carry on that legacy. It will be really leveraging those analysts that you've worked with closely. Now, some of them, of course, have moved on to other things. Jim Mueller, for example, is now working in a different capacity, so he won't be part of that team. But we do have a few including as you mentioned, Tim Beyers. Specifically, that's the team approach when I think about carrying on the work that you've done at Stock Advisor and Rule Breakers. At the Stock Advisor approach, what we are doing is, Emily Flippen, who has been such a wonderful investor and analyst here at The Motley Fool and gone on to great success in lots of different areas, leading services and working on your services in different capacities: Blast Off, Marijuana Masters, Rule Breakers at various points. We've asked her to work with me at the Stock Advisor level to really help identify the best recommendations we think about every month, which recommendation best represents the philosophy of Stock Advisor to take over and carry on that legacy you set. But the beautiful thing, the way that we've set this up is she will be able to leverage the research from across the team, from the likes of Tim Beyers, Aaron Bush, Karl Thiel, Rick Munarriz, Alicia Alfiere, Tom King. Those analysts, David, that work with you, so she will be utilizing the research and the thoughts and the opinions of that team. But really every month, she and I will work to make sure that we get the best recommendation on your side of Stock Advisor. Gardner: That's wonderful, and I love how people can't see you do this because you and I are looking at each other with Rick Engdahl's handsome face. We're all seeing each other over Zoom as we do this podcast, but not our listeners. I love how you were able to just rattle off those analysts' names one after another without looking over any list just because you work with them every day and you know them. I really appreciate that, Andy, and I want to say that team-based approach, that's the way I love for The Motley Fool to work. In fact, the Best Buys Now process which we're not really going to touch on today, but of course, Best Buys Now will continue with their process and be big features of these services. Those have always been team-based and voting-base with a lot of the names of the analysts that you just mentioned, and the others besides. It's always taken a village to make Stock Advisor and Rule Breaker happen. Emily, guided by you and supported by our team within Stock Advisor. How about with the Rule Breaker service, Andy? Cross: In the Rule Breaker service, we've asked Aaron Bush, who's been one of the best investors that Motley Fool the past really since he started with us, has built up a wonderful track record and lots of different capacities. Then David, as you mentioned, Tim Beyers. Tim, Karl, and Rick, I mentioned those three investors, you mentioned Tim to kick us off, have really been with you in Rule Breakers, I think from the very beginning, and have been instrumental in identifying companies to help you recommend to so many members over so many years. You go back and look at their track record and it really is so impressive. We certainly wanted to keep them involved. Tim and Aaron will step in to help lead that team in a very similar fashion to the way that Emily will be doing it at Stock Advisor. Now, Rule Breakers has two stocks a month, two recommendations a month, we'll carry that forward. We thought we wanted to make sure we had the right people who know your philosophy, understand that and have developed track records and can work to identify both the recommendations and as you mentioned, the Best Buys Now. Aaron and Tim will be helping to spearhead that process and identifying those recommendations again with my oversight. But really those two, along with Rick and Karl and Alicia and Tom and identifying the recommendations. Gardner: I'm so glad you mentioned that, Andy, because in fact, on next week's Rule Breaker Investing podcast, we're going to do Telling Their Stories, Vol. 3 and my two guests next week will be Aaron Bush and Tim Beyers. The two people who really have senior authority for succeeding me with the picking within Motley Fool Rule Breakers. Now, I will mention, Emily Flippen was on the very first volume, Telling Their Stories, Vol. 1, in March. If you're interested in hearing from Emily and from Rick Munarriz, long time Rule Breaker analysts whom Andy just mentioned. They both told their stories on the March 10th episode of Rule Breaker Investing this year. So, a lot of opportunity for our listeners, Andy, to get to know these analysts better. If you're a member of any real vintage and if you're a Motley Fool Live fan, boy, have you had an opportunity to get to know people like Tim Beyers and Emily Flippen better over these many months. I feel as if we're handing the baton here, and I do like the relay race metaphor to people that are very familiar to our listeners and certainly to our members. Before I let you go, I mentioned a second question.\u00a0 A lot of overlap here, but I'll just share Mike McAlister's question as well.  I've heard David speak on how he has a great team that's always been there, and will continue to be there to identify Rule Breaker stocks. However, I know David has the final say. Now that David will no longer be doing that, again, who will have the final say? I really hope that you will name a successor to David and not just do a team voting approach, and not have one individual responsible and accountable.  Mike says,  I've always believed in the saying, split responsibility is no responsibility.  While I certainly can see that perspective. Mike goes on,  My thought is you need to have one individual ultimately responsible for the Rule Breaker portfolio. Please let me know if there will be a successor to David's role of final say on which Rule Breaker stock gets picked, both new picks and Best Buys Now.  Andy, what's your take? Cross: Well, I appreciate Mike's sentiments around shared responsibility is really no responsibility. I will challenge that a little bit in a friendly Foolish manner. First of all, David, actually let me say that that is something both you and Tom definitely agree on is that we wanted accountability. Tom was very clear when he and I started talking about the plans and the investors who are in place and thinking through. I was supportive of really widening out the team and leveraging the insights from all the analysts, including our whole Motley Fool team, by the way too. We have a large investing team that contributes ideas and conversations in lots of different ways. Maybe not officially part of the teams over the years. Gardner: Yes. In fact, we have a platform, we don't talk about it that often, but it's called Fool IQ, and it's an internal platform where dozens of our analysts share some of their most recent research and their opinions about different stocks and allocate to their favorites. That's been a wonderful, growing Fool story over these last five, six, seven, eight years, Andy. That'll be another example, probably, a lot of listeners don't know that that represents a real asset. Cross: That's behind the scenes, although it just drives the full screen up. Then, of course, we have caps too. There's lots of different ways for opinions to get bubbled up, but you do need that accountability and that was one thing we agreed upon. We're still working through the exact processes to go through that, how much to carry on. We will carry on. A lot of the research, David, in the process that you've had in place over the years, but probably each investor is a little bit different, although they have their own tweaks to that. But it's my responsibility to make sure that we have the best investors we can put in to carry on that legacy for you, and also across all of our services to get the best investors to deliver for our members, but we will have somebody accountable and responsible for those recommendations. I will say there's a shared accountability for the scorecard though. It will be a conversation, maybe a debate, as we think about getting the best recommendations every month for Stock Advisor and Rule Breakers. But again, we will have a person there with me making sure that we feel really confident about the decision every month. But having that team based influence, I'll say, but a single person making the decisions. Gardner: Thank you very much for speaking to that and all of these questions, Andy, this week. I really appreciate your leadership and the hard work that you've put it in. Again, it wasn't a surprise to our company at all that I will be transitioning my stock picking responsibilities, this has been in the works for months now. I do feel really good, of course, and I've said over and over both on the podcast, Motley Fool Live, and other places, about the quality of the people and also the design of the process that has led to these forms of succession for Rule Breakers and Stock Advisor. I love being transparent. I'm so glad that you laid out some of our processes, Andy, and also some of the specific names of the analysts. I'm delighted most of all by your continued leadership and oversight of this. You've helped me out a lot over the years and I know you're going to help out our analysts a lot too. Thank you very much, Andy Cross, and thanks again for questions like, Cliff's and Mike's, and I'm sure we'll continue to get more questions from people coming in over the months and years. But I hope the question actually starts to look pretty boring overtime because I hope we have the same good answer all the way through. Andy, thank you. Cross: Yeah. Thanks, David. I hope we do too. I'm really excited about the investors we have, excited about the evolution, and certainly excited about the next steps in your career. Gardner: Well, thank you. Cross: Leaving us with such a great team to be able to pass that baton. Gardner: I appreciate that. Again, a quick plug, next week, Rule Breaker Investing, we're going to have Aaron Bush and Tim Beyers tell their story. Many different perspectives. A theme of this week's podcast continues here then with Rule Breaker mailbag item No. 3, this one comes from Matthew [...]. Matthew, thank you very much for taking the time to write in.  Dear David, I've been listening to your podcast for a few years now without fail. Last week I finally became a Rule Breaker subscriber, only to find out today that you're stepping down. I'm still eligible for a refund, but I have confidence in the team as I feel I got to know them on the podcast.  Well, let me just say again, Matthew, thank you very much. I have mentioned how you can hear our analysts tell their stories on this podcast. I also want to mention, if you think about, especially Aaron, but Emily, Tim as well, and others, they've distinguished themselves in other ways too on this podcast. For example, their excellence on the Market Cap Game Show, known far and wide. Back to your note.  Anyways, my question,  Matthew says,  Is not linked to your departure or maybe ever so slightly. I'd like to hear your perspective on a topic I ponder a lot these days. That's the importance of planning for the future versus living today fully, in investing but also life in general. I think it will help if I briefly give you some of my personal context first, that explains the three main reasons why I believe this question feels more relevant to me today. My story starts in rural France where I grew up. Nothing extraordinary, two siblings, my parents were music teachers, and we had quite a simple, happy life. We never flew to far away places or stayed at fancy resorts, but we have long holidays together, and I had the best memories of camping by the Atlantic shore. We were taught to take care of our belongings and not to value flashy things. Somehow, I became really good at deferred gratification; the idea of keeping what you have rather than using it now is so fundamental to investing, to the point that I would often save chocolate from Easter for later, only to find out months later that it [laughs] had expired. My parents were not investors. Apart from buying our family house and saving to buy a new car now and then, I think the French safety net is the main reason for that because they had a job for life, and were guaranteed a decent pension, so no real need to build a big nest egg in these conditions. Next chapter, I'm now 18. My town feels really small and I can't wait to discover the big cities. Being good at school and in science in particular, I took up engineering and studied in Bordeaux, Nantes, and even in Blacksburg, Virginia. Not too far from you for a semester of grad school. Okay. Not a big city.  Matthew says. He's referring, I think, to Virginia Tech, which is not only an excellent school for engineers and scientists, but also a pretty good ACC competitor of my alma mater, North Carolina.\u00a0 Anyway, back to Matthew, he goes on,  I interned in Paris. I found my first job in London. I started from zero, without hand me downs, but also debt-free, once again, courtesy of the French education system. Two years later, I moved to Dubai to work as a consultant for its home airline. It was, of course, the complete opposite to my small town, but I loved the energy, and having kept my values and priorities, I didn't succumb to the glitzy life. My salary would be split pretty evenly into four,  and I really am impressed by this Matthew.  Four. One, rent; Two, normal life; Three, travel. After all, I had to make the most of the perks that come with working for an airline, and four, the last 25% to savings. Because I was going to have to build that nest egg living in a place with no safety net, but hey, also no tax, can't really have it both ways,  says Matthew. Wow. A quarter of your salary to your savings and investing for the future. Of course, it's a neat trick, not many of us can play that, but it's certainly aspirational. Finishing up with Matthew's story, he says,  Now I've been in Dubai for 13 years. As mentioned, I'm asking myself how to remove that stress from constantly trying to optimize the future. I feel I'm on the right track to having a secure future, so then why do I feel the need to check the stock market every day, or to think about buying a fourth apartment in France when we just bought the third? No one wants to become the rich but stingy old person busier protecting their wealth than enjoying their life. As I mentioned earlier, I feel there are three drivers behind this question. No. 1 is maturity. I guess being older now, but also married with two amazing kids turning three and six next month, my perspective has changed. I want to make sure I can set them up right financially, but I also want to make sure I enjoy every phase of them growing up without missing out on the small joys: the tickled fights, playing Lego together, cooking as a family, etc. No. 2 driver behind this question is that my wife and I are one of the many couples created by this amazing melting pot that is Dubai. I married a wonderful woman from Uganda, which is far from home, but actually we have more in common than we have differences. Aside, the benefit is I have the best in-laws I could've hoped for and get along so well with her parents and siblings. We traveled there often pre-COVID, and along with my other travels that also gave me a different perspective. One aspect relevant for my question is that the risk of it sounding like a cliche, they aren't as stressed about planning every small detail about the near future and are better at enjoying the present. But then again, I'm an extreme planner,  says Matthew.  Often after planning a holiday for a while, I catch myself on that holiday, absorbed in planning the next day, or sometimes even the next holiday instead of enjoying this one, how insane is that?   The No. 3 driver behind my question is COVID. I must start by saying, we're very lucky, all our relatives are fine, our own health is good. The kids don't seem traumatized. We kept both our jobs. It hasn't upended our life as much as it has that many others. But I think it has changed everyone's relation to time and the ability to plan with certainty and to the 'real priorities in life'. In conclusion, I know there is no magic answer, but I'd be curious to hear your reflections on the topic. I'm really glad you're going to keep up the podcast. I truly enjoy your style and coverage of investment business in life. Fool on. Matthew [...].  By the way, Matthew, I did my best with your name. I think I nailed it, but I did receive, unfortunately, a two out of five on the advanced placement in high school after doing pretty poorly at my school French.\u00a0 Well, that was a longer note and I shared it because I love hearing people's stories, especially ones that are really interesting to me. I love your background, both where you started and where you are now and everything in between. There's never enough time to capture in one mailbag item for a given podcast of mine all the best answers. But I'll give you three quick thoughts back, you and everybody else listening. The first is, I've always loved the idea of thinking backwards from the future. I first really came across this from Jeff Bezos when he was on our radio show a couple of decades ago, and he said, he uses a geeky phrase to make decisions in life and he called it his Regret Minimization Framework, RMF, if you want to make it an acronym. But the Regret Minimization Framework, which reads roughly like this,  Ask yourself, when you're, let's say 80 years old, looking back from then to today and trying to make your best decision today. You should be making one that minimizes any regret you will feel when you're 80.  The reason I liked that framework is it's pretty loose. It's wide open. Some of the time it tells you not to do what you're thinking you might do or say. It reminds you not to do that. Other times, it emboldens you to say yes, I should do that because I sure don't want to be the 80-year-old looking back and saying,  My one-shot I never took.  Bezos Regret Minimization Framework is an excellent one that I think you and I can use as a perspective to make better decisions and see are we living enough in the present? Are we taking enough risk? Are we taking too much risk? That's thought No. 1 for you.\u00a0 Thought No. 2, if you didn't get to hear me interview Shirzad Charmine last year on this podcast, just Google Positive Intelligence, Rule Breaker Investing and you'll get to hear a one-hour conversation with someone with a remarkable background who's made so much of his life coming from where he started. A lot of it is about getting to note ourselves better, himself better, and specifically, for each of us, are we sabotaging ourselves? Are there aspects of our own thinking that aren't even real? They are just in our brain. They are what you and I tell ourselves, you know the reason he did that because he always does that or you know the reason she said that is blah, blah, blah and it turns out that may not be the reason at all. It's just what you and I are telling ourselves over and over some times as we sabotage our own thinking. Instead of looking at things positively, I think it's so helpful. We got great feedback from the podcasts we did with Shirzad last year. I definitely want to have him back on the podcasts again this year. If you don't already know PQ, you can Google, look it up. You can even take a test and learn more about yourself. I feel like I'm throwing acronyms at you with my answer is RMF is the first and PQ is the second. Well, the third one isn't an acronym at all. It's just a reflection that a lot of our perspective and I don't speak to it that often on this podcast is probably linked to your spiritual life. Now a lot of us have different beliefs, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention that, thinking about that and what are your beliefs about an afterlife or not? Where is your personal thinking in terms of the bigger, maybe the biggest picture of all, why are you here? For a lot of us, I think it's important to settle some of those questions, or at least beyond the path or the journey. But I think that perspective maybe your SQ, if you will, your spiritual quotient that has to factor into the perspective that you have today and how you decide to do what you do if the RMF and the PQ weren't enough for you. Matthew, I hope those were helpful and I really enjoyed sharing your perspective on this week's podcast.\u00a0 Rule Breaker mailbag item No. 4, and in fact, this and the next two. The next three are basically all about different perspectives and I think a lot of us can relate to at least one of these. Here comes one from Trevor Knight, Rule Breaker mailbag, item No. 4.  Hi, David and The Motley Fool team. I've been wanting to write for a few months now, but watching Tom's new recommendation video today online prompted me to finally write more on that later. First, a little bit about my investment journey. I decided to get into stock investing in August of last year and subscribed to Stock Advisor at that time. I've also found your Rule Breaker Investing podcasts earlier this year and that's prompted me to become a Rule Breaker subscriber as well. I heard that others are working their way through the entire Rule Breaker Investing podcasts history and I've decided to do the same. I'm in November of 2018, so I still have a ways to go.  Well, thank you for that, Trevor, wow.  I also want to say thank you to everything you and your team do with The Fool: the podcast, the articles, the discussion boards have been a wealth of resources on investing and the markets in general. Your podcasts especially have been a highlight for me and even though I'm on older episodes right now, it's been extremely helpful to hear some of these insights and think about how they can relate to the craziness of the current market. Well finally, regarding your brother's newest investment recommendation, I want to again say thank you to both you and Tom despite how terrible the current market has been to Motley Fool stocks. There's a lot of negativity out there and you guys are getting a lot of unfair heat sent your way. I've been spending more time on the discussion boards lately and to be honest, it sucks. People are upset. They're wondering why stocks in some cases have dropped 50% since their recent recommendation. If I really think about it,  Trevor writes,  if I'd not been reading the philosophy, reminding myself of the long-term focus of investing. I know it shouldn't have said like that and getting constant reminders on the Rule Breaker Investing podcasts, I would also be panicking. I only wish that others really understood what they were getting into before they signed up for the Motley Fool and started investing. It's easier to say you are good with volatility than to actually experience volatility. Thank you to both you and Tom for continually reminding us that we are in this for the long term. That stocks do go up and down and sometimes down a lot. I can't imagine having now much patience to deal with people who clearly didn't read what the Fool is all about. Just as a little addendum, I'm also one of the people whose stocks are down and not just down to the S&P 500 nope, down overall. I'm not one of those people who got in on one of your good companies early, I'm right there with all of those who are complaining. Sure it's not fun, but I know that I need to focus on at least three to five years down the road. Anyway, keep up the good work. Fool on. Trevor Knight. \u00a0 Well, back in the Elizabethan courts, there were the kings and queens, there were the fools, and there were also the knights, and you sir, have written very nobly, I appreciate you sharing your perspective. Indeed it is the perspective of many who would just have started in the last few months, and yes, indeed, a few of my recent picks have lost about a third of their value and for anybody who's been around as a rule breaker investing listener, this has happened a few times before in the last six years. If you've been around as an investor of any real vintage, then you've seen it many times over the last few decades. I think it's really important to keep reminding everybody hearing me right now that one year in three, the stock market actually loses value, and often that value can go quickly. As I've often said in the past, stocks go down faster than they go up. But the good news is they go up more than they go down. Again, speaking up both sides of my mouth, you have to understand both of those things to succeed in the only game that counts, which is the long game, what we play as investors. Trevor, I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but you are right, there is a lot of, not just the world, but even new Motley Fool members who may not yet have that perspective. I think our perspective is rooted in two things primarily. One is the things that we knew before we started, maybe you heard good or bad things from parents about the stock market or money, or from a school, or a mentor, and then the second thing is our own lived experience, and there's no way to substitute for that other than being in the game and letting meaningful time pass. Certainly three to five months is never going to be meaningful if we're talking about the game of the stock market. Thank you for sharing your perspective.\u00a0 I wanted to put it out there because there are a lot of people who are probably disappointed with how bad some of our favorite stocks have been just over the last few months, and yet we've had invested in them for years, we will be invested in them for years more, and I think that's the important perspective.\u00a0 Rule Breaker mailbag, item No. 5, again, we're still here with different perspectives, that is the theme as I read Doug's note.  David, congratulations on your pending retirement.  By the way, I want to mention, I'm not retiring, I'm just transitioning my stock picking responsibilities, Doug and everybody else. I'm still here with you every week on this podcast. I'm still Co-Chairman of the Company, Chair of the Motley Fool Foundation and Chief Rule Breaker, so all of this continues, but admittedly, I do have some new time for some fresh pursuits which I will eventually figure out what they are over the course of the next six to 12 months. Anyway, back to your note.  I very much appreciate it,  Doug writes,  your wisdom as a subscriber to a Stock Advisor and Rule Breakers for the past six plus years. As a weekly Rule Breaker Investing podcast listener, you and The Motley Fool have greatly enriched me and my family. As a result of my financial success, I'm now financially independent at the age of 42, and will be retiring from a professional career later this month. I look forward to being present more in my family's life while my kids are still young. I also look forward to spending more time with my parents while they are still alive. I have much thanks to give to you for your overall investing and teaching over the years, and specifically the recommendations of companies like Shopify, MercadoLibre, The Trade Desk, Amazon, Twilio, DocuSign, Zoom, and several other multibaggers for helping me achieve financial independence at a young age. I wish you the best in your future endeavors, Doug. \u00a0 Doug, thank you very much for that note and I'm sharing it because very intentionally, it's fun to hear some of the stocks, some of the companies that have given you the dream of financial independence had admittedly early and wonderfully early age. Some of those very stocks are the ones that people are pulling their hair out about, somewhere around about now, stocks that have lost a third or more of their value, even though there is still way up from where they were years ago. The very same DocuSign stock that's down about 30% in the last few months, has helped Doug and others toward financial independence, and that's because of their different perspective, and specifically letting time pass, which is the most important perspective I think that we can have as foolish investors. It's fun when we remember that happiness equals reality divided by expectations. A lot of it is what were the expectations when you started. Admittedly with the stock market so hot in 2020, a lot of people had high expectations as we entered 2021, but the market giveth, the market taketh away, tide goes in, tide goes out, and all the rest. The good news again, it averages annualized around 10% return over time. Again, annualized, that's per year, which is amazing, and that's what I'm focused on with my perspective. Anyway, Doug, thank you for that note.\u00a0 Now, to finish out this short series on perspective in different timeframes, how could I not go to Greg Heller's note, Rule Breaker mailbag, item No. 6.  David, as you step back from your stock picking role of The Motley Fool, I felt there was no time like the present to thank you for my successes as a Fool. However, winners-wise, if you'll allow me to use the made-up word.   I will, Greg, thank you.  Winners-wise, I have had few to-date. You see, I joined as a subscriber in January of this year, first to Stock Advisor, then Rule Breakers, then Market Pass and even added Rising Stars 2021. As I'm sure you know a few of those investments are positive as of mid May 2021. But this letter is not for me today, it is for me ten years from now. Having gone back and listened to the last year of the show, having read and watched and listened to as much content as possible, not just from David Gardner, but also from Tom and the amazing family you have built at The Fool, I feel so strongly positive in my expected long-term results that I don't want to wait until 2031 to say thanks. None of us knows what will happen in the future, whether it be the stock market or one's health, or anything else that happens over time, therefore, thank you. Thank you for giving me a map to follow. For the rest of my and my daughter's life, I had a good 30-year career, I've invested since I was 18 years old, but I had run out of ideas. I didn't see a good long-run plan to do much with my investments going forward. Turns out that I purchased a handful of successful Fool recommendations, such as Apple and Starbucks over the years, those have both been wonderful Fool winners, but the eye-opening approach to investing has me so excited about the future. So thank you, David and Tom for starting something so special and continuing it long enough that this Fool could finally find you. Thank you for helping me generate returns that will carry me through the best years of my and my family's life. Good luck in whatever finds you over the next part of your life, Fool on. Signed 2031, Greg Heller. \u00a0 Greg, of course, I love the idea that you wrote the note, not now whether you had losers in your portfolio, we all do or winners, nope, you did it 10 years from now and you reminded all of us of the proper perspective, not just to take in 2021, but any other year. Thank you, Greg Heller, and thank you 2031, Greg Heller.\u00a0 Rule Breaker mailbag item No. 7. I'm going to combine a couple of notes for this one. They're both reacting to our company culture tips earlier this month with Kara Chambers and Lee Burbage. The first one is from PT Lathrop. PT writes,  Hey, David loved the company cultures series. Quick note, when you asked Lee about does this asynchronous work, work? He responded with, think about what sport you're playing.  Just to fill those in who may not have heard that podcast, I was asking whether a new hybrid world of work where you're not necessarily in the same office with people that you're working with, you may not even be in the same time zone. You may have completely different rhythms. I was likening that to the idea of being in a crew shell and rowing together. It's hard to win many boat races if somebody isn't behind you paddling or somebody in front of you paddles asynchronously with you. Sometimes I've worried, the future of work, if it is async, may not be as efficient as many of us hoped for. Lee Burbage, on that podcast, countered with the idea that maybe it's not about a boat race, maybe it's more about basketball and knowing who's good at what and passing to them at the right time and people taking different places around the court.\u00a0 Picking back up with PT Lathrop, who writes,  Fair and valid enough, but I think it's more a question of, are you in the speed and quantity game or are you in the quality game? If the desired outcome is a fast or more finished product, the asynchronous probably fails to the competition. But if the value of the final product isn't generated from its rapid production and/or quantity, then asynchronous might fare well. I'm sure, us apostles never see the timelines on The Fool's projects. But as your biggest fan and content devourer, it's the quality of all your products and services that is truly your competitive advantage, PT Lathrop.  Well, thank you for that PT. Similarly, Carl [...] reacting to the same podcast earlier this month said,  Hey David, I just finished listening to your podcast from May 5th concerning company culture tips. I just wanted to say that I've been listening to your podcast since the beginning, and I really appreciate these company culture-related podcasts. I'm an unemployed mainframe computer programmer with over 38 years of experience. I have worked for many different companies in many different industries. I can honestly say that the best jobs are the ones where the company leaders truly care about their employees. These jobs are few and far between. I just wanted to say that I envy your employees. I hope they truly understand and appreciate that they work for a very unique and special company with leaders that appear to truly care about their individual well-being. Keep up the good work, Carl [...]. \u00a0 Well, Carl, best wishes for your reemployment. Sounds like you have a history of being employed, so if that is your desire, I'm sure you'll get back there, and boy, if you don't have a great perspective to make sure that if you have a day with three different interviews, maybe take the one where they care. Fool on, sir.\u00a0 Rule Breaker mailbag, item No. 8, this from another perspective, as we continue perspective week, apparently on this podcast, and thank you very much for writing in Simon [... .  Dear David, thank you for all you share in your podcasts. My initial motivation in listening was to glean some investing wisdom. However, my motivation has shifted over time and I now find myself looking forward to each episode for the stories and the creatively thoughtful way that you approach any topic.  Well, that is very kind, and thank you Simon, and I'll keep trying to do that well.  May I also salute your courage in seeking new frontiers as you step away from the familiar. Bravo, and thank you for still continuing the podcast. I made somewhat of my own life-expanding leap into the unknown, three years ago, at the age of 43, when I quit my job as a data scientist, working at a 'Tech for Good' company in London, and traveled to Southeast Asia with no plan aside from a desire to do some somatic work with people, [...] algorithms,  Simon writes,  [...] human bodies, and explore myself in a different culture. I know your appreciation of quotes so you might find this one encouraging as I did at that time.  This one's from the Alchemist, a book I'm sure many of us have read. Here's the quote,  'When someone makes a decision, he is really diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision.' These years have taken me to places which while in retrospect, seem natural. They definitely didn't always feel like that at the time. Like so many others, 2020 added its own twist as I found myself forced to transition from being a yoga and dance teacher in Thailand to primarily being a dog walker in Switzerland for 10 months after getting stuck there during a ski reunion with old friends. The funny thing is I now find myself living in an eclectic cocktail of all of these experiences as I'm now the CTO of a start-up bringing AI corrections into online yoga practice. I'm back in Thailand, working remotely, engaged to a Thai yoga teacher, and we have four dogs. \u00a0 Before I go on, let me just say both to Simon and many others who wrote in this week, and I hope you will appreciate this in light of my Weekend Extra earlier this month, I love reading the stories of people who are leading a more interesting life. Back to Simon's note,  I was planning on ending my letter here, but it now feels apt to share with you my own story with investing and the Fool. My first foray into investment was during my first year of full-time work after graduate school, the year was 1999. I had little interest in the subject apart from the desire for easy money. Boy, did I get burned in the dot-com bust so much so that I avoided any investing in shares until 2014 when after reading a technical post about how Netflix were training their machine learning models. I thought to myself that if I don't invest in this company, I'll regret it. Similarly, I then bought Tesla shares that same year after reading a blog series on Elon Musk and thinking, this guy's a winner. After a dozen more additions based purely on my own instincts about tech companies that I'd used either at work or at home, I wanted more structure and education in how to manage my portfolio and avoid the knee-jerk reaction that triggered me to suddenly sell my Tesla shares in 2020 for no other reason than because I didn't like his tweets. Coming across The Fool was love at first sight, even your name resonates with me. The tarot card that I most consistently pick in readings is the fool, a card often interpreted in a very positive sense.  Let me just insert I'm not a big tarot card person myself, but I've always appreciated that the fool, I believe, is No. 0 when they put numbers on the cards in those decks, which I think is pretty cool.\u00a0 Anyway, Simon writes,  Being able to be a Fool and break rules had brought my own life such freedom and sparkle that I was over the moon to discover your advice, principles, and lists, teaching me how to apply this same spirit to investing and I now have a portfolio that strongly reflects my values. I'm more of a supporter of the fringe, so even though I expect Amazon and Facebook to do great, I prefer supporting Etsy and Pinterest and is as geographically diversified as the far-flung corners of the globe that have shaped my own being.  Simon mentions Coupang, MercadoLibre, and Sea Limited all happily, he says, hanging out together in his portfolio.  More recently, I've learned how to take a deep breath and stay with stocks during downturns, much like one can breathe through the discomfort that can arise in a yoga pose until the body and mind unfurl to a new and deeper place of well-being. Fool on, David, and keep the podcast flowing as you explore and experiment over the coming year. Yours, Simon [...]. \u00a0 For that kind of a note, I find myself not really feeling like I need to add much. A lot of the notes we get for mailbag are often with questions where I feel a need to give an answer, but sometimes I just want to say something like amen, or in this case I would say, lead a more interesting life, and remember, happiness equals reality, divided by expectations. Thank you, Simon.\u00a0 Let's go on to Rule Breaker mailbag, item No. 9. This is back to a more technical question about investing. Thank you, Daniel J., written from faraway, New Zealand. He says to be precise,  Hi, David. What is a good time to stop starter stocks? I have been a Rule Breaker and Stock Advisors subscriber for around a year, and absolutely love both services. I've also subscribed to all of The Motley Fool's podcasts, and soaked up their back catalog, like a sponge. Using the information and insights gained from both services, I've steadily built up not only my portfolio, but also that of my two-year-old daughter. Love it. Over the last year of absorbing, trusting, and testing your guidance on investing, it's become not only an interest, but a passion of mine, one I hope to foster with my daughter in due course. Throughout this learning journey I must have really aligned with the Foolish philosophy as I noticed that 15 of my current holdings were included in the recently released Starter Stock list, included for both Stock Advisor and the separate one for Rule Breakers. 15 out of the 19 that you had on offer, is not a bad score,  says Daniel.  This discovery certainly validated my abilities in screening, evaluating, and selecting quality stocks. But my question is this, when does a portfolio not need more Starter Stocks? Is there a guideline around this? Is there a Rule Breaker trade, a philosophy that I could lean in on to help in this decision? Thankful for your amazing services, I wish I had discovered The Motley Fool sooner, my daughter, sure will, sincerely. Daniel J. \u00a0 Well, let me speak to Starter Stocks, briefly, Daniel, and everyone listening. Starters Stocks are a list of stocks that we've created that we refresh and update annually for both Motley Fool Stock Advisor and Motley Fool Rule Breakers, and yes, the newest additions are out as of the last three to five weeks or so between those two different services, and each one features a list of about 10 stocks, that we call starter stocks. Now, here's what we mean when we say starter stocks. That is a list of stocks specifically curated as our best ideas and picks for people who are new to our service, who are new to investing. The mental picture I've always used as a skier is a green circle. If you are a snow skier too, you will know that the green circle slopes are the bunny slopes, they are the easy ones. They're flat and welcoming, nobody should get hurt there, and everyone's having a good time. While the stock market can never promise that, sometimes the stock market does hurt us and even bunny slopes stocks can get knocked down in bad markets.\u00a0 Nevertheless, if you think about a company like Apple, for example, over the years, that's frequently been featured on that list and understandably so, one of the largest companies in the world, one of the best brands in the world, a company whose consumer products many of us recognize and probably touch every day. That would be a great example of a starter stock. Now the starter stock lists are there to get started with. We want you to get investing right away, you don't need to wait for our next monthly pick and then you have to wait for another month before getting a second pick. We've always generously tried to provide you a platter of delights that you can enjoy right away. That's the purpose of the starter stocks list. Daniel and others, the intent is not, by the way, that those are just for beginners or rookies or only people who could ski on green circle slopes. That really is not the case, most of those stocks I've held for a long time myself and would add to them anytime. The idea is not at all that you could ever overpopulate your portfolio or somebody else's with starter stock. I just want to make sure you understand the purpose of that list and how it serves, but you also would understand then, that we're looking for great companies, that are a little simpler to understand and invest in, they're probably a little bit bigger, a little less volatile. You can ask yourself in each case, is this one I want to have in my portfolio? I think I'm speaking to somebody who knows how to answer that question for himself, and his two-year-old daughter. Thank you for writing in.\u00a0 Finally, this month, Rule Breaker mailbag item No. 10. This one comes from my friend, Sam Stevens.  Hi, David. It took me an extra week to digest your ten-and-a-half chapters podcast, as it truly was a rich masterpiece of everything Rule Breakers that you've built over many years. It actually made me quite emotional, listening to it, as it reminded me of just how much you and this podcast have enriched my thinking, and consistently brightened my day since its inception. While I'm sad to see you leave The Fool, I'm actually really happy you've made this choice, a very Rule Breakery choice, stepping away from the game when you're on top, and in your prime, is a rare, but powerful move, that places you in good company, Michael Jordan, Sandy Koufax, and Bill Gates, to name a few. Your announcement made me think back to my first experience with The Motley Fool as a high school student. At an elite private school in Washington DC, I was fortunate enough to be part of an investing club that got to take a field trip to Motley Fool headquarters. The connection was, that longtime Fool employee, and I will certainly say podcast personality Bill Barker, his wife was my English teacher. It was truly an awe-inspiring experience to hear a panel of Foolish all-star investors, David Gardner, Andy Cross, and Joe Magyer. Three legendary investors and teachers, I still can't believe you guys took the time out of your day to speak to us about the importance of investing, and getting started early. That afternoon made an impression on me, so powerful, that I can say with confidence that one afternoon is the primary reason I've developed a passion for investing in the stock market, started a career in the world of investing, including an investing internship at The Motley Fool, which I cannot recommend highly enough to any young listeners. Reflecting on my experience,  Sam writes,  I think about just how fortunate of an upbringing I had to attend the school that I did and to be introduced to The Motley Fool and investing the right way at such a young age. I absolutely love the Fool's mission to help the world invest better, but back when I interned, in 2012, my only complaint, with what was overall and unbelievable company in The Motley Fool was that it felt like its reach was concentrated in folks who were already older and wealthier, could afford a subscription, had enough money to invest such that $10 commissions back then didn't prove an unnecessarily high barrier. At the time, I used to think about how so many young people lacked a good financial education and were completely spooked out of the market after the 2008, 2009 stock market crash. But how the world has changed, investing is now commission-free. The Rule Breaker Investing podcast has been a marvel, bringing a truly unbelievable track record of success for free to the masses, especially younger people who are more likely to listen to podcasts. I've actually kept my own Rule Breaker Investing podcast, five-stocks sampler tracker and by my rough estimation, you've beaten the S&P 500 by an average of 79% per pick with a 59% accuracy. In fact, if you'd invested $100 in every pick, that's $2,000 a year, that's $11,500 total. If you'd been invested in an S&P 500 index fund you'd have a little over $18,000, but with free Rule Breaker Investing picks you'd have over $27,000,  and Sam includes a link to his tracker. Well, thanks Sam.  In closing, I'm excited for the possibilities you'll have, as you step away from running the Rule Breakers premium service to spend more of your time teaching and inspiring young people, especially those who are less fortunate than I was, too many today. Despite the additional resources out there on the Internet and the success of The Motley Fool, too many today still get led astray trying to get rich quick on Dogecoin or GameStop. I cannot wait to see what comes next from you and I'm very thankful, the RBI podcast, will still be a part of it. I count you among my top three heroes. \u00a0 Well, thank you, Sam,  in the world and I can't thank you enough for how much you've inspired me. Fool on.  Sam Stevens, whom I enjoyed working with nine years ago, thank you. For this final perspective, shared among others coming from different places around the world, on this month's Mailbag, May was quite a month, I'm looking forward to June. But we're not there yet. Keeping things in perspective, and doing our best to live in the present, with at least an eye or an ear toward the future, I'm thinking back to Chapter 3. A couple of weeks ago, My Road Less Traveled in 10-and-a-half chapters. Sam, and I hope many others, you will know that chapter, listen to it again, as Two Fools. That was its title, and that is what we are. You and I, Sam. That's what we are, you and I, my many correspondence this week from Thailand or the French Coast of the past, or New Zealand, or Dubai and that is where we are. Dear listener, you, yes, you with an opportunity to spend a bit of time together each week along the stony path of life. My dearly departed mother left me a painting of hers which hangs in a prominent place in our house today. It's a picture of a Fool. She painted the traditional kind in cap and Motley entertaining young people seated in a circle around them, the motto painted at the bottom. She pulled this from a book, speaks well to us, and I think, my perspective here at the end of this week's podcast for you, dear listener, and for what we do together here at close, it reads,  This is the way that one in cap and Motley stops for awhile along the stony path of life to make you laugh.  Fool on!

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Allison Malkin of ICR. Thank you. Please go ahead, ma'am.

A live broadcast of this call is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.rh.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary. Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Great. Thank you, everyone. We're going to start with an overview of our Shareholder Letter, which highlights our results and outlook, and then we'll open the call to questions. To our people, partners, and shareholders, fiscal 2021 is off to a strong start, with revenues up 78% in the first quarter versus down 19% a year ago. Total Company demand increased 101% in Q1 and RH Core demand increased 109%, the strongest demand trends in our industry. We continue to set a new standard for financial performance among home furnishings retailers with adjusted operating margin increasing 1,260 basis points in the first quarter to 22.6% versus 10% a year ago. Adjusted net income increased 375%, and adjusted diluted EPS increased 285% to $4.89 per share versus $1.27 last year. We generated $228 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter and $136 million of free cash flow. Q1 ended with total net debt of $382 million and trailing twelve months adjusted EBITDA of $896 million. Our expectation is to be net debt free by the end of this fiscal year. Increase in fiscal 2021outlook: Based on current business trends, we are raising our outlook for revenue growth in fiscal 2021 to a range of 25% to 30% versus our prior outlook of 15% to 20%. We now expect adjusted operating margin in the range of 23.5% to 24.3%, an increase of 170 basis points to 250 basis points versus our prior outlook of 100 basis points to 200 basis points, with ROIC in excess of 60%. As it relates to the second quarter, we expect revenue growth in the range of 35% to 37%, and adjusted operating margin in the range of 25.9% to 26.1%. While fiscal 2021 will surely be a tale of two halves, there are many data points that lead us to feel optimistic that our strong performance will continue through the second half of 2021 with growth reaccelerating in fiscal 2022 and beyond. These include a strong housing and renovation market, both with pent-up demand and a long tail, a record stock market, low interest rates and the reopening of several large parts of our economy. Additionally, the un-masking of the general public could lead to a Roaring Twenties type of consumer exuberance. Town & Country captured that feeling perfectly on the recent cover of their magazine, titled,  Remember Fun? Get Ready for the Comeback! . Combine that with the largest new product introduction cycle in our history beginning this fall, and the launch of RH International next year, and fun it could be. You should also rest assured that we have pressure tested our business assumptions and risks, and are confident in our ability to maintain an adjusted operating margin in excess of 20% in just about any economic downside scenario we can envision. The emergence of RH as a luxury brand generating luxury margins. We have spent decades building a brand and business model that generates industry leading profitability and return on invested capital, and believe, like Bernard Arnault, Luxury goods are the only area it is possible to make luxury margins. With 21.8% adjusted operating margin in fiscal 2020, RH has eclipsed the operating margin of LVMH, and we now have a clear line of sight to 25%-plus adjusted operating margin over the next several years. As it relates to our business model, what is often overlooked is the simplicity and low-risk nature of what we have built. I thought it would be helpful to highlight some of the key attributes. No Seasonal Inventory: We don't offer seasonal categories like Valentine's Day, Easter, Halloween, Thanksgiving or Christmas. Nor do we carry collections or color palettes tied to spring, summer, fall or winter like many home furnishings or home improvement retailers. We spent years eliminating those categories to avoid seasonal markdowns, enabling us to have a significantly higher margin business. Limited Fashion Risk: Our business is not driven by the fashion cycles found in retail models that require frequent discounting. The major trends that drive our business are tied to architecture and the dead. Architectural trends tend to change over decades, not years. As an example, many point to the 1997 opening of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain by the legendary architect Frank Gehry, as the beginning of the recent modern movement. We launched RH Modern almost two decades later in the fall of 2015, when a critical mass of modern homes and condominiums was reached, establishing a sizable new market. As it relates to the dead, generations pass away and their belongings move through estate sales, which feed the antique markets, which drive the high-end interior design market, which influences the high-end reproduction market, and the trends continue to flow downstream. If you want to know where the mid-century modern trend came from, do the math or visit a cemetery. Membership: Moving from a promotional to a membership model, as we did in 2016, simplified and streamlined our business, eliminating the chaos and costs associated with a constantly changing customer proposition. Membership also deepened our relationship with our customers as the majority use our interior designers to furnish their homes. This evolved our business from selling products to selling spaces, driving higher average orders and lower customer acquisition costs as RH has become their top of mind choice for luxury home furnishings. Luxury Positioning: Luxury brands have proven to be less susceptible to economic downturns as their customers may temporarily pause their spending but do not lose the ability to spend. Additionally, investing in the home grows exponentially as customers accumulate wealth, acquiring more homes, which drives higher sales, resulting in lower advertising costs, and a more profitable operating model. A Compelling Vision For The Future: We enter this new decade with a compelling vision for the future, a team passionate about bringing that vision to life, and the strongest brand and business model in our industry. We plan to launch an unimaginable amount of innovative new strategies designed to further elevate and expand the RH brand. As I did in my recent annual shareholder letter, I will outline the strategic separation we've created and the strategies we are pursuing as we continue our quest to become one of the most admired brands in the world. Product Elevation: We have built the most comprehensive and compelling collection of luxury home furnishings under one brand in the world. Our products are presented across multiple collections, categories, and channels that we control, and their desirability and exclusivity has enabled us to achieve industry leading revenues and margins. Our customers know them as RH Interiors, RH Modern, RH Beach House, RH Ski House, RH Outdoor, RH Rugs, RH Lighting, RH Linens, RH Baby & Child, RH Teen and Waterworks. Our strategy to elevate the design and quality of our product will continue as we introduce RH Contemporary in 2021 with a 400 page source book, dedicated website, national ad campaign, and a freestanding RH Contemporary Gallery in the San Francisco Design District. We also have plans to introduce RH Couture Upholstery, RH Bespoke Furniture and RH Color over the next several years. Gallery Transformation: Our ability to transform our legacy stores into multi-dimensional Design Galleries that double our retail revenue and profitability in every market will enable the RH brand to reach $5 billion to $6 billion of revenues with a mid-20%s adjusted operating margin in North America. These inspiring and disruptive physical experiences render our products more valuable while creating strategic separation and unmatched brand awareness, enabling us to gain significant market share at lower advertising costs. This presents a conundrum for our competition who are closing or downsizing their stores while we build the largest specialty stores in the history of our industry. We believe our Galleries are proving to be a huge competitive advantage, enabling RH to acquire customers at lower fixed costs versus variable digital advertising costs that can change daily for store-less or store-closing brands. All you need to do is walk a mall to notice most retail stores are archaic windowless boxes that lack any sense of humanity. There's generally no fresh air or natural light, plants die in most retail stores and they can't be a good environment for humans either. That's why we don't build retail stores, we create inspiring spaces that blur the lines between residential and retail, indoors and outdoors, home and hospitality. Spaces that are filled with fresh air and natural light, with garden courtyards, roof-top parks, restaurants and wine bars. Spaces that activate all of the senses, and spaces that cannot be replicated online. RH Dallas, which opened in May of this year is off to a tremendous start with our roof-top restaurant booked until August. Our plan is to open three additional Design Galleries in 2021, including RH San Francisco, RH Oak Brook, RH Jacksonville, a freestanding RH Contemporary Gallery opening in San Francisco, plus our first RH Guesthouse, opening in New York this Fall. Brand Elevation: We are beginning to evolve the brand beyond curating and selling product to conceptualizing and selling spaces, by building an ecosystem of products, services, places and spaces designed to elevate and render our product more valuable while establishing the RH brand as a thought leader, taste and place maker. Our Products are the core of our ecosystem and include RH Interiors, RH Contemporary, RH Modern, RH Beach House, RH Ski House, RH Outdoor, RH Rugs, RH Lighting, RH Linens, RH Baby & Child, RH Teen and Waterworks. Our Services, RH Interior Design, RH Contract, RH Trade and RH In-Your-Home render our product more valuable while extending the brand into adjacent businesses that amplify the core. As an example, we believe that RH Interior Design has become the largest residential design firm in North America and has facilitated our transition from selling products to selling spaces. RH Trade serves external interior designers and design firms, partnering on projects and acting as a support organization managing the logistics of large, complex designs. RH Contract serves the Hospitality and Commercial markets with design and logistics support for large scale, volume projects. RH In-Your-Home, elevates the customer experience with Furniture Ambassadors managing every detail of your delivery, extending the selling experience into the home while creating a memorable and lasting impression. We are also exploring the opportunity to expand our services to include RH Architecture and RH Landscape Architecture as we receive constant inquiries regarding the design of our Galleries, Garden Courtyards and roof-top Parks. Our Places include RH Galleries, designed to elevate and render our product and brand more valuable, RH Restaurants, which further elevate the customer experience while driving high quality, incremental traffic to our Galleries, RH Guesthouses, where our goal is to create a new market for travelers seeking privacy and luxury in the $200 billion hotel industry, and RH Residences, fully furnished luxury homes, condominiums and apartments with integrated services that will deliver taste and time value to wealthy and affluent, time-starved customers. Our Spaces, conceptualized to inspire and elevate the brand, will initially include Plane & Yacht Design and Charter, where customers can access our design experience, view our work online, and charter RH1 and RH2, our private planes, and RH3, our luxury yacht, which is available in the Mediterranean and Caribbean where the wealthy and affluent visit and vacation. We will also be unveiling our first RH Bath House & Spa as part of our Aspen Guesthouse, scheduled to open in the second half of 2022, as well as other exciting spaces we will be revealing over the next several years. We believe our seamlessly integrated ecosystem of immersive experiences inspires customers to dream, design, dine, travel and live in a world thoughtfully curated by RH, creating an impression and connection unlike any other brand in the world. Digital Reimagination: Our strategy is to digitally reimagine the RH brand and business model both internally and externally. Internally regarding how we innovate, curate, and integrate all the dynamic aspects of our brand, and externally as we introduce our customers to The World of RH, a new digital portal presenting our Products, Services, Places and Spaces. This multi-year effort began internally last year with the reimagination of our Center of Innovation & Product Leadership, which will incorporate digitally integrated visuals and decision data designed to amplify the creative process from product ideation to product presentation. Our external efforts will begin this fall with the launch of phase one of our new digital portal, The World of RH, which will include rich, immersive content with simplified navigation and search functionality, all designed to enhance the shopping experience and render our product and brand more valuable. We believe an opportunity exists to create similar strategic separation online as we have with our Galleries offline, reconceptualizing what a website can and should be. Global Expansion: We believe that RH has the potential to become a $20 billion to $25 billion global brand in its current form, and possibly larger if aspects of our ecosystem become meaningful revenue streams. Our view is the competitive environment globally is more fragmented and primed for disruption than the North American market, and there is no direct competitor of scale that possesses the product, operational platform, and brand of RH. Our global expansion begins in the spring of 2022 with the opening of RH England, The Gallery at Aynhoe Park, a 73 acre historic estate designed in 1615 by Sir John Soane, arguably one of the most respected and celebrated architects of his time. RH England will feature The Aynhoe Architectural Library, The Aynhoe Organic Gardens, The RH Restaurant & Orangery, and The RH Champagne & Caviar Cellar among other unique experiences. Pending reopening plans for France, our goal is to open RH Paris, The Gallery on the Champs-Elysees in the fall of 2022. Customers will arrive through magnificent 18-foot gates and walk down a decomposed granite path lined with majestic hedges that lead to a garden courtyard where you encounter 18-foot brass doors and open a -- that open to a six-floor atrium connected by traversing brass staircases and a glass elevator. RH Paris will include a restaurant overlooking the gardens inspired by the Grand Palais, a sparkling Champagne and Caviar Bar on the top floor, and a romantic roof-top garden where you can sip an RH Bellini while enjoying views of the Eiffel Tower. In total, we have secured five locations in Europe including London, Munich and Dusseldorf, and are in final lease negotiations for an additional five locations which will open over the next two to three years. Climbing the luxury mountain while building a brand with no peer. Hermes, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Cartier, Tiffany and the rest of the finest luxury brands in the world were all born on the top of the luxury mountain. Never has a brand started at the base, as we have, and made the climb to the peak. We believe RH can be the first to make the climb, knowing very well those at the top don't necessarily want us to. The truth is, we're not from their neighborhood, nor invited to their parties. To make the climb, we understand that our work has to be so extraordinary that it creates a forced reconsideration of our brand, requiring those at the top of the mountain to tip their hat in respect. It is not a climb for the faint of heart, requiring imagination, innovation, and a great deal of persistence and perspiration. We have to be willing to endure short-term pain to drive long-term gain, as we did moving from a promotional to a membership model, elevating our product, transforming our stores, redesigning our operating platform, or managing the business with a bias for earnings versus revenues as we built a financial model to support long-term high-quality growth. We also understand the strategies we are pursuing: opening the largest specialty retail experiences in our industry, while most are shrinking the size of their retail footprint or closing stores; moving from a promotional to a membership model, while others are positioning their brands around price versus product; continuing to mail inspiring Source Books, while many are eliminating catalogs, and, refusing to follow the herd in self-promotion on social media, instead allowing our brand to be defined by the design and quality of the products and experiences we are creating, are all in direct conflict with conventional wisdom and the plans being pursued by many in our industry. We believe when you step back and consider: one, we are building a brand with no peer; two, we are creating a customer experience that cannot be replicated online; and three, we have total control of our brand from concept to customer, you realize what we are building is extremely rare in today's retail landscape and we would argue, will also prove to be equally valuable. I want to thank the people of Team RH who live our values and fight for our cause. A team that is building a culture of leadership versus followship, that strives to innovate versus duplicate. A team of people with the courage to continue the climb even as the air gets thin and the odds get slim. A team of people willing to get knocked down ten times and get back up eleven as they strive to plant the RH flag at the very peak of the luxury mountain. Carpe Diem. I'll now open the call for questions. Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett -- Analyst Hey, thank you. Good evening. Incredible results to the team. Gary, is there any way to size up the degree to which categories such as Outdoor supporting total sales growth, maybe the penetration of the category in 2018 versus where you think '21 can end up? And are there any other categories that you believe you're seeing outsized growth today is just exceptional results? Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think if you look at our demand trends everything's way up, right. So -- but Outdoor is one of our best performing categories. I mean, we're the most dominant outdoor brand at the high-end in the world today, and have the biggest business in the world with high-end for Outdoor by multiple. So, you would expect that we dominate that category, even though there is really long lead times and we've been sold out for a good part of the past year. Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett -- Analyst Great. And is there any other categories that you would highlight besides Outdoor? Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Again, if you take the Core business that's 109% demand growth in Q1, they're all way up. So, the business is strong across all categories. Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett -- Analyst Great. And then in your shareholder letter last week, you wrote, we have to be willing to endure short-term pain to drive long-term gain, and you referred back to a lot of the other growing pains in the business over the past few years. But I was just curious if there's something down the road that you were referring to in terms of the future outlook? Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. It's just -- it's the mindset of investing with a long-term view to build one of the most admired brands in the world, and it's not a path that most people take. I mean, you've got -- most of the world is focused on duplication and moving a lot of small rocks, and we tend to focus on big rocks that create big value, and those sometimes take multiple years to move and to bring the life. And so -- look, I think if you look at our guidance, it would indicate we don't see anything in the near future that could be disruptive to our results. And today, as we think about that investment horizon over the next several years, whether it's international or digital reimagination or product elevation or any of the big moves we're making, they're all implied in our outlook in our guidance. So -- but from time to time, there may be a significant investment we have to make that's going to leapfrog the business further into the future, right. I mean that's the way we have an operating margin that's, I don't know, almost twice the next best person in our category. Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett -- Analyst Great. Thanks, guys. Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer You bet. Operator [Operator Instructions] Next up, we have Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Adrienne Yih -- Barclays -- Analyst Good afternoon. Let me add my congratulations. Eloquent as always, Gary. Gary, I guess my question is about the TAM opportunity -- or actually the $5 billion to $6 billion sales target in North America in the $20 billion to $25 billion, you talked about it being in the Company's current format. So, can you talk about the number of galleries that supports North America, but more importantly, the number of galleries that supports globally? And is it just focusing on the home furnishings industry with industry, but no hospitality, no B2B etc.? So just want to get some more color there. My follow-up will actually be, when you're opening the stores internationally, all of the different cities and different countries, is there anything that you're doing from a product market research or customization for each marketplace? And should we assume that each of those stores delivers the same sales dollar, or is everyone of them distinct? Thank you. Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hi, Adrian. That was a lot of questions in one question. Okay. [Speech Overlap] Where do you want me to start? Let's see. Let's -- the opportunity as it relates to the $6 billion in North America, $20 billion, $25 billion in the current format, how many galleries in North America and how many galleries internationally? It's an interesting question, because in North America, I think we've always said about 60 to 70 galleries in North America to kind of penetrate North America. And you've got to think about the fact that we've built America -- we built North America while we've transformed the brand and transformed the business, right. So, we've -- we had a pretty logical footprint that was in all the major markets and all the major suburbs, so on and so forth, and we basically consolidated and transformed in opening large Design Galleries and replacing the former footprints. And the question is, do you need as many galleries internationally as the world continues to evolve and change, right? As consumers continue to be comfortable shopping online, not seen products, that's somewhat unknown, I think, to us. If there is no indications today that we should have less galleries in North America, we wouldn't penetrate the markets the way we penetrate the markets today with less galleries as we do the math. So, even though there is kind of a migration online, you really got to be careful in today's world not to look at the channels independently. I really would caution any retailer who is doing that. I think it's a foolish way to look at the business, because we live in a -- we're physical beings living in a physical world and being able to see brands and know brands in a physical manner, being able to understand how big they are, what their assortment is, what they stand for, what the quality is like, what the taste and style, it's like, I think, critical. And so, my sense is, if we're going globally, might we be able to build a few less galleries? I don't know. I don't think so. I think that replacing physical stores with digital advertising is a bad move. I don't know why anybody would want to sign up for a variable cost structure that could change daily to market a brand, right. And so, physical stores are basically big brand building statements that are three-dimensional that customers can interact with, they can touch the goods, they can interact with the brand, they can see the size and scale of things, they can understand the taste and quality and style, and all kinds of levels. And I think that's impossible to replace that with some kind of digital advertising or other advertising format, especially when it's not a fixed cost format. So, our view, while there is migration online and stuff like that, there is just natural migration online even if you have a physical gallery. That doesn't mean anything. It just means once the customer knows you're brand and shopping from you, they might go home and make a transaction after they've seen it in a physical store. The people who believe they can close a lot of stores and have the same market share, I think are naive. So we -- when we look at this, we think our footprint will be similar to North America, that's how we look at it today. We're studying. I think I mentioned on the last conference call, our businesses basically breaks down 80% suburbs, right, 8% -- 12% second homes, and 8% kind of city urban locations. And I believe that will be similar internationally. I think, we wouldn't be wise if we said, oh, all we need is a store in the major cities in Europe. I just don't think we capture the market share we would in North America. It's no different than when you're in a country -- in the city, you kind of know the business better. Like, for instance, if you came to Corte Madera, California, and you're at our Center of Innovation, four blocks down the street is RH Marin, the legit Corte Madera, there is no luxury stores in that mall today, not one. Nordstrom, if you want to call it a luxury store, I don't call it luxury store, is the highest brand store. And if you want to call Apple luxury, you can call -- there is an Apple store there, but there is not another luxury store in that entire mall. We opened one of our big new galleries there. It's got a restaurant, and it's going to be massively successful. And if we probably weren't here and didn't have a, what, legacy store in the mall, we wouldn't have understood the potential in Marin County, and we would have been a lot smaller. I'm sure other luxury brands, now that we've built our big gallery, they're going to follow. Actually I heard Tiffany has taken a location now, and now that LVMH and Tiffany, I think, we're going to see that change. But -- so I think we're going to be pretty similar as it relates to the products. I think the world is getting smaller and smaller. A lot of people say to me, oh, the houses are smaller in Europe. Not really. Are the city homes somewhat smaller? Yeah, the city homes are somewhat smaller, and the urban demographics of North America also. And everything we carry comes in all sizes. We sell sofas from what six-feet to whatever, how many ever feet you want, right. You want a five-feet, we'll make you five-foot sofa. So, our products come in all kinds of sizes. I think we've got the assortments that will be appropriate for the world. And I think the world wants RH. There is nothing like us out there, and I think our brand is going to translate very well. So, I tried to answer all those questions. I don't know if I missed any. Adrienne Yih -- Barclays -- Analyst You did. Yes, you did. Thank you so much. Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer All right. Thanks, Adrienne. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Steven Forbes -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst Good evening. Hey, Gary. Given your comments in the letter about you maintaining a 20% EBIT margin in any scenario you can envision here, because I think we're all living in the scenario land, I'm curious if you can provide some color on how you're thinking about the potential path of demand growth as we head into the back half? And if you can contextualize sort of the downside scenario, I think, you've tested in the model, so we better understand the flexibility that you see, or that sort of inherent right to the model that you have? Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. So, look, I think anybody that's not -- things that go up generally that you have no control over don't necessarily stay up. The question is, how long do they stay up? What does it look like when things evolve and return to some kind of normal? But this isn't a new normal. And I think it's naive to not really look at all the models. And, look, if you were talking to me a month ago, I was a lot more pessimistic than I am today. I'm a lot more optimistic a month later, because I have more data and the organization we have -- we can see more trends, and we can see what's happening. And not just data internally as how our demand trends look and as we look ahead, what's happened and what we think will happen, but just what's happening in the housing market, what's happening in stock market, what's happening in the remodel world, the pent-up demand that exists. And if you think about people that are building homes, the homes are taking longer to build. You can't get the trades. People can't get people to remodel their homes. All of that means that they haven't bought their furniture yet, right. We're kind of the last stop on the journey. So, there is this kind of pent-up demand back up. A lot of things that indicate to us when we think about our pipeline and look at our pipeline that look very good as we look out into the rest of the year, and possibly into next year. And when we get into next year, we've got some step-ups, right. We're going to introduce a record amount of kind of new products beginning in the later part of the second half of this year. That will mostly accelerate revenues in 2022, right. We'll ship some of it this year, but not a lot of it. So, as we look look at it, we kind of look at the current trends, we'll get something in the second half for new stores that we just opened, new stores we are opening, we'll get some for new products, but really those will set up '22. So, we have all of that momentums going into 2022, and then we start opening internationally. And internationally, it's very different than opening a new gallery in North America, because most of our galleries in North America are replacement galleries. There're just a couple that are -- like Jacksonville, you can argue that's the -- new marketers expanding to Florida market. We've only got a couple ahead of us. We're not in Hawaii, and we're not in Montreal. I can't even remember if there's anything else we are not... Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer Naples, maybe. Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Naples, yeah. You can argue Naples probably could be incremental, but they're not probably a 100% incremental, because we're somewhere in those countries are ready. But we're not in the United Kingdom, right. We're not in France. We're not in Germany. We're not in the Netherlands. We're not in Spain, I mean, on and on and on. And so we're going to be opening countries, which is a very different dynamic, right. And we're not only opening countries with a handful of galleries, we're opening countries with a multi-dimensional digital portal that people are going to have -- entire country is going to have access to the brand. And then we'll probably figure out like how do we think about selling cross borders until we establish our presence there and delivery and stuff like that, we may be able to -- we may well reach more the continent. I'm sure there's going to be customers they're going to want us to ship to Russia and the Middle East and so on and so forth, and we'll figure out how to do those things. We want to officially open up the continent of Europe when we opened the first handful of galleries, it just a bit complex from an operational point of view and would create too much upfront costs. So, we'll kind of learn as we go there. But that gives us a step-up. So, when you think about the downside model, which is important to look at, right. And, like, we've had it ever since we've been -- ever since we saw this uptick, we said, look, it's -- how is this going to play out? And so, today, my view is, the rest of this year looks pretty good based on everything I can see and know right now, right. Could the stock market fall apart? I don't know, it could. Could the housing market slowdown? I don't know. Like, your guess is as good as mine. But -- my data is probably as good as yours and vice versa. So we're all kind of speculating into the future. And every plan we have has some degree of wrong. The question is are we more right than wrong. And today, I believe we're more right than wrong about the outlook we gave you, right. And we tend to be relatively conservative in our outlooks and give ourselves some room to navigate. But I think about it this way. As we built our models, we went back and said, what would normal have looked like, right? What would 2020, 2021 and 2022 in our long-term outlook for the Company look like? It would have looked like kind of 10% growth in 2020, not 8%, because we couldn't ship things, right. So, we didn't really benefit from COVID last year. And that's the point I tried to make. And only 8% revenue growth, we got operating margins to 21.8%. So, not really a COVID leverage like most other retailers. We have no cash and carry product, right. Yet, we don't -- what we saw, one-tenth of 1% of our sales walk at a store. I don't think we have anything that walks out of the store in a bag unless somebody really needs a towel [Phonetic] that day. So, we have a really a direct-to-customer platform. It's all delivered to customers' homes. A lot of it is special order, have longer lead time, things like that. And it's not things that also you can turn on a dime and say, hey, we're up 40% and the manufacturers can start delivering at that level. So, we had this big backlog that's flopping over. Will that backlog continues at about the same amount, about $150 million as we look forward? Will it all catch up this year? We don't know, it depends on how the trends look. Probably, not all of it will flop in this year, because as we ship those goods, we'll create new backlog. So, we're not exactly sure when will -- it will all kind of normalize. But if you looked at our longer-term plan, we would have said, hey, normal like up 10%, up 13% to 14% in 2022 as we opened internationally, right. And we would had a bigger uptick then. So, we kind of look at it and say, OK, we are up 8%, instead of up 10%. This year, we're -- you know the guide. And then we kind of look at it and say, in 2022, if we were -- if we landed where our normal business would be, what would that look like roughly, right. And so -- and then, at that level, we're seeing now let's give back any of the COVID lift. So, we've got math around what did we get that we shouldn't have got, and we take that out, which is some number, you can do the math. And then we said what if -- like, we are in the longest economic expansion in the history of the U.S. right, without a recession. So, at some point something is going to happen, be naive and foolish to think it will never happen, so you got to be ready for it. So, we said OK, let's say, there is a economic downturn of 20% in 2022, and you take that -- and that's a big one, right, because that looks like 2008, 2009, where we were down about 15% or so. So, if I take 20% out, and so it's taken out of COVID lift, that's taken out 20%, and we're still at 20% operating margin, slightly above. So what I feel good about is that's how good our model is, right. That's how good our model is. And what I feel comfortable and confident about when people ask me, hey, should I buy your stock, I tell people the same thing. I'll say look if you're a trader and you're short-term -- you're just focused on short-term episodic moves, don't buy our stock. If you're an investor and you have a long-term view and you're going to hold the stock for five years and more, you're going to make a lot of money here, and just as people did since we IPOed. And you guys have seen the numbers on that. And so, there is a lot of upside in the story. There is a -- it's by far the best model in our industry. No one's got anything close. It's all a little math, because some people have a lot of COVID lift right now and it looks like their business is better and their margins are better, they're not promotional. Look, no one's promotional right now. Like that -- Jesus, like -- for God's sake, how can you be promotional with kind of the demand trends and you can't even get the inventory. So, the good news is, it doesn't affect us, because we're never promotion, right. So, our margins are margins, right. So you can count on our margins being our margins. Would I count on everybody else's margins being their margins? Not at all. There is no way when the world returns to some kind of normal in the home industry, the people that used to promote are going to have to promote again. And it's very foolish to think they're not. I'm just happy we made that move from a promotional model to a membership model long time ago, because we don't have to change anything. So, our margin structure is our margin structure. The only thing you're seeing in our margin structure that might be giving us a little lift in through this period is we have less advertising expense. So, we cut back advertising. We couldn't get the goods. But if we would have the advertising expense, we would probably done more volume, but there is no sense spending the advertising and mailing books when you can't get the inventory, right. That would have been like just burning money. Light a match and burn the money. So, we decided not to launch new products, not to advertise. Like -- and -- so my sense is when the advertising investment returns, we'll have the inventory and we'll get an incremental lift in the top line. And that's another thing that we're -- should have wrote about that in the letter, now that I think about it. The fact is we've got -- we've pulled back in advertising. So, when we start mailing books again, that's also going to create momentum in the business. So, that's why we feel today, Steve, very confident about how we think about the rest of this year and what it looks like next year, and we feel extremely confident that if the world changed and the home industry gave back any COVID lift, and you pop on top of that at a recession and you give back another 20% of business, we're going to be in the 20% range and we're going to be able to play offense and take a lot of market share and do a lot of smart things that I don't believe other people are going to be able to do. Steven Forbes -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst That was super helpful, Gary. Really appreciate that. And then just as a quick follow-up, it's sort of hard not to get excited here about RH International. So just curious, as we're -- what are we, less than a year away, right? What else needs to be done to ensure a smooth and seamless launch as you sort of prepare for this grand opening here? Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. All the things that you would expect. I mean, we've got to build the operational platform from a distribution and logistics and home delivery perspective, which we're working on and building. We've got to make the inventory investments and be able to get the inventory, which we're working on and we couldn't have launched this year, would have had no inventory, right? So we had to delay everything by a year. Thank God, we did, because we wouldn't have any goods to sell. So we have to have the inventory to build the inventory. And you'll start to see that being reflected in our balance sheet as we build the inventory for international. And then we've got to continue building the team. And the good news is -- what's the latest pull, how many people from our organization want to work for us internationally? Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer A couple of hundreds -- Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. We had several hundred people that have already volunteered from America to go work in Europe. So, we've got -- and some of them are from Europe. So we've got a lot of enthusiasm about people who want to go help us open internationally. But plus, we've got a team that's -- and we've got a leader on international and we're building that team. And if you came here and you're in our center of innovation, we have giant RH International room with maps and dots and cities and numbers and volumes and populations and things we have to do and where we have to go and where do we open home delivery, where do we open this and that? So yeah, we're working on all the things you have to do. I mean, the good news is they are all the things that we do here. So, it's not like there's anything really new. It's just in some cases -- for the most part, everybody speak in English. It's not like 50 years ago. And there's slightly different currency, things like that. And then the question is, how do you price the goods. And I think that the good news is, is we study it and we look at how other brands have priced their goods. There's probably a bigger margin opportunity than we thought. So we feel more positive than less positive that RH International, as we begin to scale it, will actually be margin accretive, not margin dilutive. Steven Forbes -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst Thank you guys. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Tami Zakaria -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. -- Analyst Hi, this is Tami. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is around international openings. I think in your shareholder letter, you mentioned you're going to open 10 locations in total over the next two to three years. So probably the cadence, I'm guessing, is two to three international opens per year over the next two, three years. So does that mean you plan on opening an equal number of US and international locations over the next couple of years? So basically what I'm trying to understand is what is your gallery opening cadence over the next two years and how is the split between international and domestic. Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. Thanks for the question, Tami. And by the way, you're kind of -- you had a crystal ball, I saw your note right before we announced and your projections are pretty close to our projection, so good job on your models. But the gallery opening cadence in North America will remain somewhere around, I'd say, three to five or so, maybe four to six, depending on how these deals come together. And then international, I would look at it and say we've got two in the first year as long, as France opens and we can get work done there. So Paris will either open in the fall of next year and if for some reason, we continue to have COVID delays and we can't get in and do the work we need to do, it could go into the spring of the following year. But beyond that, we have the other locations, some of them are much easier to open than others. They're less complex. These first few are relatively complex, and then London is relatively complex. Some of them are less complex where some are not quite as big a footprint, and where we have an ability to kind of test, if you will, and have some flexibility. We don't want to be locked in everywhere in a bunch of countries where if we made a mistake, we have a permanent mistake. Net-net on Aynhoe in England, that will be a relatively low net capital deal as we bought the property, investing some money. We'll do a sale leaseback. We'll have more capital in Paris, that's a long-term lease, and then we'll have more capital. And we're more [Indecipherable], if you will, in London in Mayfair where we're kind of stringing together four buildings to make a spectacular gallery. But some of the other locations, we have shorter leases on and we're making a much smaller capital investment, just so we can understand the markets and understand the country, still spectacular real estate and buildings. I mean, the great thing about Europe is you have all these spectacular buildings. I mean, in the United States, North America, you search for a building of stature and taste and style and great architecture. Europe is filled with them. So we love the buildings. We love the real estate we're taking. We believe they're the right locations, but we don't know for sure. So, we want to learn. So, we've got some with shorter term leases that give us flexibility. We're going to invest less capital. We're not going to open restaurants everywhere because that's a bigger capital investment and we'll kind of test and learn and then we'll have kind of flexibility and mobility to kind of make a bigger investment once we know those markets better. But to the consumer side, they're all going to be spectacular. As we look at it, they're slightly smaller. Not all are going to have the restaurant investment. But we have a lot of galleries in North America that are our old legacy galleries that do big volume, are highly productive, and these are much bigger than those. I'd say some of them are more like our kind of 1.0 design galleries like Houston or even Boston where you've got 15,000 to 25,000 square feet as opposed to 50,000 square feet to 60,000 square feet. That is all I have. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser -- UBS Investment Bank -- Analyst Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Gary, it seems like what you're suggesting is RH has spent the last 20 years or so building this unique luxury brand that hasn't existed in home furnishing. It now has pricing power and should command luxury margins, which we've seen you realize in the last several years and COVID has allowed you to accelerate that process by raising prices and getting to the margin level that's appropriate for the fitting a luxury brand in this market. Is there a case where you haven't gotten a great sense of elasticity in your core customer segment because of -- or the size of your core customer segment because of these unique conditions and that could change on the other side of this? So that's the first part of my question. And then the second part is who is in the demographic that you've seen come in buying? What have they been coming to buy in the last couple of months to drive this level of growth? Thank you. Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So I'll start with the second question. It's really that -- it's kind of a core RH customer, nothing different in the demographic that's buying from us. Just more activity, more movement, more people moving, more people moving from cities to suburbs, second homes, things like that. And then more people just refurnishing their current homes just because they've been spending so much time in their home and they couldn't really travel. So people doing their outdoor spaces and stuff like that and that's all continued to be strong. As it relates to COVID speeding anything up, it really hasn't speeded anything up. Not for us. I mean, this year, it's going to give us a lift. But again, if you just go back to last year and say on 8% revenue growth, 7.7% revenue growth, we had 21.8% adjusted operating margins, right? So that was lower than we thought we be. We thought we were going to 10% to 11% growth. And so our model is pretty clean if you look at it through 2020. And then this year, you've got -- you have some lift. Obviously, we're going to be up 25% to 30%. And so the way I'd look at it is model us out over 3% -- if you model this at kind of 10%, 10% and 13%, you'd kind of be directionally right, plus or minus 1 point or so here or there. And then the question is what is 2022? Is 2022 a giveback year or a flat year because the COVID cycle, the focus on the home goes back? I mean could be. We've got things that should make it a better year than that because of the fact that we haven't introduced new products, how long it's been now? 18 months at most? Allison Malkin -- Investor Relations It will be two years in the fall. Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Okay. It will be two years, OK, in the fall where we haven't introduced new products. Think about that. Two years. No new product at RH. So we've got quite a backup that will be introduced this fall, next spring. Just the product pipeline for the next 18 to 24 months is a really dynamic pipeline and of new products in everything, right. In RH Interiors, RH Modern, not just RH Contemporary but interiors, modern, baby, child, teen, beach house, ski house, there's a lot of new product coming in as well as RH Couture Upholstery, RH Bespoke Furniture, RH Color, lots of things we've been working on. So that's a big plus to us. And then we're opening up internationally, and that's a big plus, right? That's a 100% incremental, right? It's not like just transforming a gallery where it's a market that is already doing $15 million, and it's going to go to $30 million or $25 million market is going to go $50 million. So this is not incremental markets, incremental countries and then thinking about it more as an incremental continent. Because at some point, we'll open enough galleries in Europe, and we'll have our infrastructure and home delivery figured out, and then we'll just open up the whole continent, whether we have galleries everywhere or not, we'll be able to figure that out. The big thing is why you can't rush to just open up the continent is you have to figure out the reverse logistics, right. You have to figure out, what am I going to do with the returns. Because what you don't want to do is all of a sudden like open up the country too soon, and you've got a bunch of returns in Russia or Copenhagen or places where you've got no infrastructure, no outlet infrastructure, and you've got no way to handle the goods and you'll just lose a lot of money all day along, right? So we're just trying to be prudent about how we open up these countries, at what point do we have the infrastructure in place and have figured it out. Figured out how to handle returns, how to handle the back-end logistics and how to wire that to change like what a lot of people don't know, I mean both, but I'm public, not going to say it. I mean we made in our reverse logistics outlet business, we made a -- it's about a $200 million business. We've had $100 million difference in profitability in that business over the last four years. $100 million, OK? We know what it looks like when you don't run that business well. And we know what it looks like when you run that business well and you figured it out, all the handling and transportation costs and everything that goes wrong there. So we just want to kind of build a really great business and a really great model there. So we'll go a little slower. But when you think about our model and the COVID piece, this year is going to have a little COVID lift. But if you look at the growth that will come next year, whether it slows down or not, where we're at this year? It's kind of a good place because we have other things that will balance it out. But the good news is like -- and by the way, we didn't really take any price changes increases because of COVID, right. So we just took our normal kind of price increases because that's what we do. And because we have pricing power and we're a luxury brand, we can pass through price increases in other parts of our business and that's one of the advantages you have when you're in the plan in the luxury market and you have exclusive product and you control the distribution, right. But I wouldn't say our business is that COVID effective except for the leverage we're to get with the big -- with a lot of the revenue that's going to hit this year. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi Research. Steven Zaccone -- Citigroup -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Congrats on the strong results. Maybe shifting to the margin side. Given such strong performance here in the first quarter, is there any real change in thinking about the drivers of gross margin versus SG&A on a full year basis versus the initial guidance you provided back in March. And then I guess specific to the second half of the year, given the momentum in gross margin, is there opportunity for gross margin to continue to expand? Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jack, do you want to take that? Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer Steven, I don't think anything has changed with respect to what we said in the last quarter. If you look at historically what's driven our operating income margin increases, I kind of view it as sort of three quarters of it roughly coming up in gross margin quarter up in SG&A. And of the gross margin, the bulk of that, call it, three quarters coming from product margin and the moves we talked about elevating design quality taking the margin of the goods up. So that's been pretty consistent as we look at the model back four or five years, as Gary was talking about the evolution. This year we'll have a little bit odd comparisons because of the way 2020 played out. So obviously, with Q1 down 19% last year, Q2 being flat and the growth rates we have now, you're going to see a little bit swings in sort of the, I guess, the margin deltas versus last year. One thing we were just looking at -- or that I like to look at is in the same way that people look at two-year growth rates, I would look at margin changes on a two-year basis as well versus '19 and that sort of formula that I alluded to earlier holds ongoing and I would expect that going forward. Michael Lasser -- UBS Investment Bank -- Analyst Great. Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer And then I think the opportunity for the gross margin to expand just to address that. I mean there's always that opportunity I think you know our position on how we communicate our guidance and our outlook numbers to you and how our internal models are positioned. But it's something that we -- where we do well, we continue to elevate the design, the quality, and the luxury mountain, and I think you've seen the benefits of that, and I think that will continue to accrue to us. Steven Zaccone -- Citigroup -- Analyst Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. Anthony Chukumba -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you so much for taking my question. Congrats on strong start to the year. So Gary, I mean, you guys are doing a lot of different things right now, a lot of very exciting initiatives, particularly the international expansion, but all the product newness and some of these new concepts. And I guess my question is, how are you personally allocating your time, because I know -- or I'd have to imagine that you're very, very intimately involved in a lot of this, particularly the international expansion. And so I would just love to get a better sense for that. Thank you. Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer It's a good question. We say inside our company, we really do two things; we allocate human capital and financial capital. And then the most important one is human capital and how we allocate our time. So we don't work on any things in this company that the cross-functional leadership team can't work collaboratively on. So whether if you look at the kind of the big product initiatives, and thinking about the product initiatives, this happened over years, right, so that by the time you're seeing contemporary coming, we have been working on contemporary for a long time. We've been looking -- working on color for years. We just -- it's just been other things more important than we've launched, so color keeps getting kicked to the back of the bus because we don't think it's as incremental as some of the other things that we're doing sooner or maybe not as important to elevate the product brand. But all the big initiatives we take kind of the cross-functional collaboration of the entire leadership team to move the big rocks because they're all big rocks, whether it's product elevation, whether it's gallery transformation, brand elevation and the things that we're doing there to elevate the product and elevate the brand, the things we're doing to digitally reimagine the business, not just the website, but digitally reimagine the way we move information and data and how that can amplify the productivity of the teams and the decision-making of the teams and then global expansion. They're all things that as a leadership team, we allocate our time. We ranked everything in this company through a lens of what's the emotional value, what's the strategic value and what's the financial value in that order, right? Because to do really great work, you've really got to deeply believe in it. You've got to be able -- you have to be so excited that you'd rather be doing that than something else because to do extraordinary remarkable and amazing work is not for the fainted heart. It's not easy to do. Being the best in the world at what you do is not easy to do. It takes a tremendous amount of effort. And you're not going to put in that kind of effort. You're not going to have that level of commitment unless there's real high emotional value around an initiative and the strategy. So we only focus on things that we're deeply passionate about that we're really aligned about that. The entire leadership team is passionate about because we've got to work on that in a collaborative way, and we've got to put in a tremendous effort. And then the second thing we look at is what is the strategic value of an idea. How does this idea render the brand or business more valuable? Does this idea create strategic separation between us and others in our industry? And the ideas have to have high strategic value. And then third is financial value. And a lot of companies, I think, work on it exactly the opposite way, and that's why they don't do great work as someone comes up with an idea that this is a $1 billion idea, and nobody is really that passionate about it. So nobody works that hard on it, they get knocked down two times and they don't get up a third time. When you're really passionate and you believe deeply in what you're doing, you get knocked down 10 times you get up 11 times. You just keep going as you care so much about what you're doing. So those financial ideas that people articulate that there's not high emotional value generally don't pan out. They become like what happened to that $1 billion idea? Yeah, we wound up -- we drove into the ditch and we couldn't get out and it never happened. But the things you really care about, they tend to be worth more over time. We might have something that has really high emotional value, really high strategic value, and it looks like moderate financial value. But what we've learned is, over the course of time, people seem -- they're so passionate, they're working so hard, they tend to uncover more opportunities, see more. The work is better than you could imagine, and the financial value goes up over-time. So what you thought might have been a $500 million idea turns into a $2 billion idea because the work is that damn good. And so -- but we spent a vast majority of our time debating and deciding how to allocate our human capital, how to allocate our time because that's the most important thing we do. We -- I can always go figure out how to raise more money. We can go get more money. I haven't figured out yet how to get more time. So we spend our time figuring out how we're going to allocate our time because that is by far the most valuable resource in the company. And when you think of these, it seems like there's a lot here, Anthony. And there is -- we've been working on this stuff for years like these are not like new. These are just now we're talking to you about them. And so somebody asked me how long have you been working on the guesthouse? I said I've been working on the guesthouse for 25 years, for as long as I've been traveling and frustrated about the experiences and asked, why doesn't anybody do this? Why didn't anybody do that? So I designed the room for the guesthouse like 25 years ago. So you'll see it's way better, by the way. I'm pretty passionate about it -- of the organization. And by the way, if you ask me two, three years ago, like even three years ago, how do you feel about the guesthouse? How big of an idea it's going to be? I would say, yes, it's good. I think it's going to be great. It's going to be a very good idea. Now I'd tell you, I think it's a redefining idea. I think it's going to define an entirely new market for privacy and luxury. I think it's so damn good, it's going to shock people in the industry. But that's just because we're really passionate about it. So it tends to become really great work, no different than RH Contemporary, we're really passionate about it. There was a team in here last night, last couple of nights until, I don't know, 2 in the morning. You couldn't get them out of here because they're so damn excited about what they're doing. And they know it's going to break through and it's going to kind of change everything. So it seems like we're doing a lot. But by the way, that's our nature. We do a lot. But we're also highly focused. We know how to edit. We know how to say no to 1,000 things. You're seeing the handful of things we decided to focus on and that we have the capacity to focus on and you don't really know the whole team here. You don't know the depth and breadth of the organization we've built. We've got a very deep team and a lot of talent in this organization. So you don't want to lose people because you're not working on enough extraordinary things. They'll go somewhere and they can go work on something extraordinary. So if you want to have the best talent, you better be working on the most exciting things in the world. Otherwise, they'll go work for somebody else. I wouldn't worry that we're doing too much. People have been saying that about us forever. Anthony Chukumba -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst Got it. Thank you so much. And I look forward to having champagne and caviar at RH England next year. Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Okay. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Curtis Nagle with Bank of America. Curtis Nagle -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Good evening. Thanks very much. Maybe just turning back to international. Maybe a little too early to ask or assess this. But just, I don't know, Gary, how do you think about kind of like what -- I guess, the baselines or the comps would be for some of these early markets you're doing, London and Paris, where you've got these magnificent spaces, recognition of the brand by certainly a decent number of people in those cities, but they are new markets. I mean the benchmarks -- I don't know, perhaps New York, maybe that's aggressive, is it L.A., San Fran? How do you think about that? And then just as a quick kind of model question. Could you comment on kind of what demand trends are doing now? Are they sort of proportionately similar to what you saw in 1Q in terms of how they are balanced relative to sell-through? Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. Yeah. As far as international, we think about London like New York. If you look at the population demographic profile of the broader New York market, broader London market, they're profiled pretty close. If you look -- think about the UK, we think about the UK a little bit like we think California. There's 68 million people in the UK, and there's 39 million people in California, so it should be bigger. If you look at the profile of kind of high net worth and ultra-high net worth people, California skews a little higher per capita. So we look at California and say, California is probably long-term $800 million to $1 billion market. So London should be somewhere around $1 billion market. We got to have the penetration of galleries and the brand recognition to get there. But the upside is we're opening some pretty spectacular places. We're opening with a brand that's got kind of worldwide recognition with our core customer. It's not like people don't know the brand at all unless they don't travel to America or they don't have any friends in America, right? If they travel to America and they have wealthy friends in America, we're on their radar. And so the question is just like how quickly does it scale? We don't know. We'll know more when we open them. We're going to do a great job. I think we're passionate about it. The work we're doing is going to be extraordinary, and it's going to be remarkable. And I'd like to say that when you do extraordinary remarkable work, you can usually figure out how to monetize it, but it's very hard to monetize ordinary or unremarkable. So we feel better than worse. We feel excited about this. We're very passionate. As it relates to demand trends, we gave the demand trends through last year because it was kind of such an odd year. We don't want to get in the habit that we're giving demand trends for the rest of our life here, and within a quarter, but you can back into all that stuff with the numbers. We gave you pretty fulsome guidance. So we gave you a relatively normal guidance that we would have given before, right? So we're not here not giving you guidance. We gave you guidance for Q2. We gave you guidance for the full year. You can back into those, and you can kind of figure out what the demand trends might have been no differently than you would have had through our historical guidance, but we just don't want to sit here and what we're going to do is track a bunch of short-term hedge funds and day traders. If we're talking about like, hey, through last week, we're here. We want people who are more long-term based. But you can figure that out. I think we've given the most fulsome guidance I've seen anybody given so far this year. Curtis Nagle -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst [Indecipherable] Thank Gary. Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Great. Thank you. Thanks Curtis. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Max Rakhlenko with Cowen & Company. Max Rakhlenko -- Cowen & Company -- Analyst Great. Thanks a lot and congrats on a really nice quarter. So just staying on Europe, just curious on the margin side. What do you think profitability could look like versus the US? And I think earlier on the call, you said that margins might actually be accretive. So just curious how you're thinking about GM versus SG&A and then just leverage on the overall business? Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I don't think we're ready to talk about that level of detail. I think when I think about it directionally and strategically, we believe that we think it can be accretive to margins long-term and pull our model up as opposed to be dilutive to our model. We're going to have to get some scale. We're obviously going to open distribution facilities and capabilities and make investments in inventory and other infrastructure that we've got to be able to open the business to And depending on how quickly we ramp and how quickly the business ramps will determine how the model evolves. And so when we're talking about it, I'm talking about more long-term like we studied now a lot of people's businesses, a lot of models, what people are charging, what they're charging there for similar goods and we look like a tremendous value. And our view is it can be a higher-margin business than the US. And also the reason it can be somewhat higher margin as you just don't -- like traditionally, a lot of people -- American retailers that would open in Europe, they duplicate all kinds of jobs. They duplicate buying teams and duplicate corporate overhead and infrastructure and things like that. You had a lot of levels of duplication, and we don't believe we need to do that. We're going to run it more as a like -- look at the world is kind of one place and we'll have very few duplicative infrastructures. I mean we obviously have to have some human resources and people, leaders and people running stores and oversight and stuff like that, but we're not going to duplicate many of the things that other businesses or brands have done. I mean the good news is we don't need a big inventory management team. Think about most retailers. Most retailers are filling their store with product that they're selling out of all the time and they're replenishing all the time. We don't do that. We set up a gallery and nothing moves for a long time. Like nothing moves. We make sure that we steam the beds and we straightened it up. But nothing is moving in our galleries, right? So we don't -- when you think about the complexity of inventory management in a normal retail store or other home furnishings retailers that are selling stuff off table tops and this and that, that are in the cash and carry business, we're not in the cash and carry business, much simpler model, much simpler model. So they would have to build big inventory management teams and duplicative teams in different countries, right? They'd have to think about all these different profiles and what sell-through rates and all that other stuff. We don't have to do that. We keep a DC in stock, right. And everything pulls from there. So it's a much, much simpler model. And those are the -- yes, a lot of those reasons is why we -- or why we think it's going to be accretive to operating margins. We just don't have a lot of duplication. Max Rakhlenko -- Cowen & Company -- Analyst Got it. That's very helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up. On RH Contemporary with the continued supply chain disruptions, just how are you guys thinking about fulfilling what will probably be really strong demand. Are you guys able to bring anything in ahead of time or is that not really feasible given that the business is really custom driven? Just curious how the team is approaching these challenges as your sites have a lot of newness over the coming quarters? Thank you. Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes, good question. It's not that it's all special order. It will probably have a slightly higher special order mix to start, but we will stock a good portion of the product. And the real key is the supply chain catching up, and what the demand trends are and what's the level of kind of in-stock rates can we be at? And that will determine, we'll probably go all the way to the wire to figure out how many books we may, how big we get behind this just so we don't drive another giant level of backorders and long lead time. So we've got a few months here to see how the supply chain is happening, how people are catching up, what the current demand trends are going to be and we'll figure that out as we go. But there is a bit of a supply chain constraint and that's why we haven't launched anything in a long time. But right now, we feel pretty good that kind of middle to late, I'd say late September, early October, we look like we can launch Contemporary. And we'll launch the business. But it's like our business, people get a book, they don't start ordering that much in the first few days. It's about a month to digest it, the designs, does that work in my house and so on and so forth. So by the time people really start ordering contemporary, we should have pretty good in-stock rates, but it will keep getting better and better and better as we move through the end of the year. But we think we'll be in a good enough shape. But for some reason, the demand trends are bigger than we think as we move in -- through the quarters, we may have to just launch contemporary in a smaller way. And so -- but look, it's all a good problem to have, right? It's not like nothing's selling here. It's just that, OK, you don't really want the demand trends to go down so you can launch contemporary on time, right? Like that would be bad to wish for. I'd like the demand trends to stay up. And a good outcome would be, hey, guys, we've pushed contemporary to 2022 because our demands are damn strong, right? Now some people would say that's really bad. I think that's really good. That means our business has continued stronger than we thought. So it's not really exactly when we launched contemporary. It's going to happen as depending on demand trends and the ability to ramp production. Max Rakhlenko -- Cowen & Company -- Analyst So high class? Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think we cut off. Operator Your next question comes from the line of David Bellinger with Wolfe Research. David Bellinger -- Wolfe Research LLC -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking the question and congrats on results here. So just looking at all the success over the past few quarters through the membership model, how much have you seen your customer base grow over the past call it, 12 to 18 months. And more importantly, where can that number go over-time as you build toward the $5 billion to $6 billion sales target for North America and a much larger opportunity on the international side? Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We don't really give that data. Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer David, I might say, I mean our membership count is disclosed. You can look at it in our 10-K. So last year, as Gary talked about 8% revenue growth on membership went up by 4.6%. So we went from 415,000 members to 434,000. That's one proxy. Clearly, sales in general tend to outpace with increased average order values, other things we've talked about that tend to outpace the growth in members or customers. David Bellinger -- Wolfe Research LLC -- Analyst Got it. Okay. And then just as you think about the trends here, it's incredibly strong throughout Q1, are there any regions of the country that you're seeing within that strength that are either outperforming or being held back in some way and did you see any moderation trend in some of the areas of the country move closer to normal or is this more of just a broad-based strengthening throughout the entire business? Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer It's pretty broad-based. Yeah. I mean you had through this pandemic, obviously, the core dense cities where you had more of an exodus of people. Those were softer. The second home markets were explosive. The suburbs were explosive. And now you've got the cities that people are coming back and we're getting close to the unmasking of America that the cities are -- the energy is coming back, the business is coming back, and they'll probably have a stronger kind of later surge is how we think about it. David Bellinger -- Wolfe Research LLC -- Analyst Got it. Fair enough. Thank you and best of luck. Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Next up is Cristina Fernandez with Telsey Advisory. Cristina Fernandez -- Telsey Advisory Group -- Analyst Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask a follow-up question on Contemporary. Do you think that line will bring a new customer to the business like Modern did a few years ago and how are you thinking about presenting it in stores the price points. Maybe can you compare that to the launch of Modern, like how this one is going to be similar or different? That would be helpful. Thank you. Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. We think it's going to be a lot like Modern. We think it will bring a new customer into the business. It's higher price points like Modern was versus the Interiors business. So it's a higher level of quality. All the new product kind of reflects the elevation of the product and the brand, right? So you'll see higher-quality, higher-priced product kind of flowing in over the next several years as we take the brand up the luxury mountain. You'll see the quality get better everywhere. You'll see the design get better everywhere. You'll see the designers and people we work with -- people will be more aware of them, designers that -- a lot of people said would probably never design for RH are now coming onto the platform. And so you'll see the product continue to elevate and that should have a positive impact on average order, average ticket and a lot of good things that help the model of the business. I think that's the thing that you got to think about long-term with our business as you're kind of going up the luxury mountain, you're taking quality up, you're taking design and quality up, you're also taking price points up. You have more pricing power there. All the leverage flows through, right? I tell people all the time, imagine if you're selling a $2,000 sofa or a $10,000 sofa, I mentioned a $10,000 sofa because that's our best-selling sofa. So it cost you roughly $200 to deliver a $10,000 sofa, it's a fraction from a shipping cost point of view as it is to deliver a $2,000 sofa, right? Your 2% versus 10%. So it cost you one-fifth, and that's why you can get such better margins here. So when you think about margin growth long-term, you've got to understand, we're still climbing the luxury mountain from a product point of view. I kind of look at it and say, we're slightly above halfway, maybe we're 60% up the mountain, 65% up the mountain, the product quality, the product design, the taste and style, the brand is going to continue to go up and we're going to continue to be disruptive at the highest end of the market, right? That's where we think that the most opportunity is, the kind of independent showrooms and a small boutique, high-end stores and retailers. So that's all going to be very accretive to our model. And that's why I think I mentioned before, I don't know if it was one or two quarters ago, kind of a couple of quarters ago, I talked about kind of the correlation to Hermes and not that we put ourselves in Hermes kind of -- place Hermes in the world from a brand point of view, but we aspire to things like that. And Hermes has, I think, 34% operating margin. And yes, so there's a lot of good things happening during this climb. It's hard to make this climb. No one's ever made this climb. Everybody who's up there is born at the top. So we're kind of in uncharted waters here, as we climb. But it's all good stuff. The leverage that customer acquisition costs, everything here is margin accretive, the path we're on. And I think a lot of people overlook that because they're so used to building models further. No one prior this -- there's not an analyst or investor that's ever built a model like this for a home business. People ask us all the time, are you more like -- should I look at Home Depot, should I look at this? Are you like this? Or are you like that. No, we're like nobody. Like go look at other category -- other categories, there's people like us in other places, there's no model like us. That's why there's no results like us. So everything we're doing is going to be accretive to margins. Cristina Fernandez -- Telsey Advisory Group -- Analyst That's very helpful. And then my second question, last year and this year, your source book strategy changed, you only mailed one. Do you think you go back to like spring and fall like how are you thinking about just broader about advertising source books as its business normalizes in 2022? Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Sure. We used to do 11 or 12 a year, right? And then we went from 11 or 12 and we went to, I think, three, then we went to two, then we went to one, then we went back to two. Now we're at zero. So we'll go back to at least one and then we'll keep -- the world is changing, right, all the time. When we open these big -- one of the things to study, to think about, when you take RH -- again, I mean it's great because we had this point of reference here right next to us and I encourage anybody who hasn't -- if you haven't been to our center of innovation, product leadership, you ought to come out here and kind of see not only what we're doing, but how we do it, and you'll understand how unique and different we are. And then we'll take you to lunch at RH Marin and we'll walk you through. But if you just like walk them all and look at, oh, there was our in-line store in the mall. And then you see us as a third anchor in the center that you can't miss when you come driving up to this place. You got to think about the fact like, hey, how many source books do we have to mail in Marin when everybody in Marin who is a potential customer of ours is going to at least come have lunch or dinner with us once a month, maybe a little less frequently, but most likely. And every time they go to the mall, they go to Nordstrom, they go to Apple, they get a drive by our magnificent gallery with how many 100-year-old Dollar Trees surround it? Like it doesn't even look like it belongs in the parking lot, but it's this magnificent thing. And if you just look at it and then you look at -- you just walk the mall and you look at all these other sad retail stores, you go, well, no wonder, they might have to spend a lot on advertising. They're all like 30 to 50-foot storefronts with like a little kind of crappy storefront. And they have no windows, except for a little glass in the storefront and you walk into kind of a windowless box and everybody looks the same and someone is standing behind the register. It's all kind of the same. And so when you build the galleries that we build and you do the volumes we do and you've got the hospitality component driving lots of traffic, I got to believe we're going to spend a fraction of the ad cost of everybody else to optimize the market. So everybody looks at the negative investment into a retail store and nobody does a positive. I tell people all the time, it would be an interesting world, if we could all just go peek at it. It would be a world that only had online retail that like -- think about the last couple of hundred years, you could only buy things in stores. I mean, buying things online, and there was no stores. And then all of a sudden, somebody invented a store, and they did a bunch of volume. And all of a sudden, everybody started opening stores and there was a shift to retail stores. And all of sudden you go, everybody -- excuse my language. You go, heck, everybody starts closing their websites because stores is where it's at. Nobody ever kind of shifts the perspective and listed it differently. We're going to follow the herd mentality. Humans are followers for the most part, and we don't like change. And so everybody is just like following the herd, they think like, oh, everything is going to go online. In my lifetime, we will not see more volume in online than we are going to see in retail stores in our categories, it's not going to happen, unless everybody closes their stores and they force it to happen. And that's really good. I hope everybody sells our goods, closes their stores. It'd be the best thing to happen for us. Our operating margins might be 40 if they do that. I hope they do. But look, right now, let them all follow each other, and let us be the only inspiring magnificent physical spaces in the world. I like the fact we'll be kind of a market at once. So is Apple. So is Tesla. So is all the great companies. They're generally market to one because they don't follow everybody else. You got me excited on that one. But imagine that world. It'd be like a gold rushed open retail store. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital. Bradley Thomas -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst Hi, thanks so much. Lot of exciting things to talk about. Gary, you mentioned an interesting point in the letter about the RH Dallas restaurant being booked through August. I was hoping you could just give us an update on where the overall restaurant business stands and its reopening and recovery and how that flow through is translating over to the extent you can tell at the restaurants that have opened sooner than others? Thanks. Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I think it broke up a little bit. What was the question? Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer Around F&B -- the overall F&B business Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer The F&B business is coming roaring back. And look, one of the things we did, we took the opportunity while everybody was sheltering in place, we reimagined our hospitality business, we redesigned our menus, our pricing structure, our turn times, our service standards. We've got a tremendous leadership team and we believe we're going to make a huge impact once we can go back to kind of full service, a huge impact in our F&B business, both from a revenue and a margin perspective. So many of the restaurants that like maybe it would have been $5 million or $6 million, we think they'll now be $8 million or $9 million, maybe up $10 million just by the enhancements we've made. We used to have -- our pantries used to be more of a coffee bar. Now it's really a wine bar and we have 40 wines by the glass. We found out that, hey, you have 82 points of margin on average when you've wine by the glass. So that's a really good business to be in, it's way better than coffee. And look, coffee is not a bad business, right? You wouldn't mind being Howard Schultz Starbucks. But we like the wine business. It's a really good business. When you're paying somebody to kind of go carry something to a table, if they're carrying a $4.50 glass -- cup of coffee to a table versus a $24 glass of wine to the table, think about what that looks like on their payroll as a percent of sales. Again, everything we're doing, keep thinking moving up the luxury mountain, kind of higher price points, more leverage, more volume, serving actually kind of fewer customers and you make a lot more money. So F&B, we've kind of done the same thing. We've elevated the menu, elevated a lot of things. In fact, yeah, most of the menu elevation we're doing right here right now in Marin, and we'll be rolling that out. I think that will be a significant impact. But I think we're in a -- I think we have one of the great hospitality businesses in the world right now. Like our volumes are incredible. Our model looks incredible. Most of our restaurants are packed all the time. And we can't wait until we can get to 100% seating. And I mean, just out of the gate, Dallas looks like it's going to be a $10 million-plus restaurant and with the new wine margin structure, which is really good and they're drinking a lot of wine in Dallas. So we feel good about it. Like it's going to be a good part of the model. And when you think about how much traffic it drives to our galleries and what that does and then what that traffic does to offset advertising costs and other things, it all looks incremental to us. Bradley Thomas -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst Great. Thanks so much Gary. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush. Seth Basham -- Wedbush Securities -- Analyst Thanks a lot. My question, if you can hear me, is around the design services business, and you mentioned it being the largest in North America. Wondering by what metric you're measuring it? And then secondly, could you give us an idea of what you've learned from that business over the last two years and how you might translate it to Europe? Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. Yeah. If you just look at the volume our interior design business generates and the volume our trade business, which is really part of our design services generates, support the external interior designers. I mean we're really if you look at design firms, residential design firms, I don't know if anybody that's larger than us or close to larger than us. So it's been a big, big enhancement to our business. It's moved us from kind of just selling products to selling spaces and moved us from products to projects. And so it's a huge, huge strategic strength of ours and we've created a great strategic separation and we continue to invest in that business, I mean, it's an important business for us. And as it translates to Europe, we think it's going to be very successful in Europe. If you just stand back and think, how many times in people's lifetimes did they get to kind of furnish an entire home? Very few times. Therefore, why would they be any good at it, right? You can't be good at something you only do a couple of times in your life. And that's why if you look at -- I would say look at Zillow or look at Redfin or look at anything and just go through the most expensive houses, the least expensive houses, you generally see bad architecture and bat interior design. And so we think we can make a big impact in the way people live and to live with not just more beautiful environments and spaces, but massively more functional and logical. People just -- they don't know how to do it. Why would you be any good at it? And if you'd be like walking on to a tennis court for the first time if you've only been a bowler or something like that, why would you be good at tennis? I mean, I think it's interesting, a lot of people are like, oh, I want my home to really reflect me. Well, that's great. But if you're not seeing a good interior design, your house will reflect you, and it's not going to be any good. And so I think our service now that it's out there and the great thing about our design service and why we're so successful at it and why it's so much more impactful than other people is the galleries, right? The galleries in the source books and the way we present goods, we don't build retail stores. Most people selling furniture and home furnishings, you walk in, and it looks like a retail store. You got dining tables piled up with all kinds of seasonal craft on them. You've got stuff all over. You've got shelves full of pillows and candle sticks and tchotchkes and all kinds of stuff. I mean it looks like a mess. It doesn't look like a home. It looks like a store. You walk into one of our galleries, it looks like a home. Not just -- it doesn't look like any home on Redfin and Zillow, it looks like better than any home on than Redfin and Zillow. So it's a very inspiring physical manifestation of our brands, and people want their homes to look like that because they haven't seen anything that looks that great. And then therefore, that gives our design teams credibility because the marketing -- they're servicing the customer within the example of the work, right. That's why we have credibility. If you walk into kind of any of the other people that people might go buy from, it's a bunch of crap all over. It doesn't look like we want to live with like a dining table with a bunch of tchotchkes, Halloween or Christmas stuff piled on it or pillows all over shelves everywhere and candle sticks everywhere. And like most retail stores, you walk them all or you walk in at home stores from furnishing stores, they're like a mess. We look like a beautiful inspirational space. So that's why it works, and that's why it will translate. But you can't just like say, oh, we have design services, great. If your stores look like shit, nobody cares. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Zachary Fadem -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hey Gary, two questions on guesthouse. You said a lot of exciting things here. So first, I'm curious if there's anything you can share on the revenue model. And then second, maybe you could walk us through the food and bev or experience offerings versus a typical boutique hotel? Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well, we're not building a hotel. So I don't know how to compare us to one. But the guesthouse revenue model, you'll learn more about it once we open it. We're going to have fairly expensive rooms. We're building an experience that the world's never seen. So it's not going to be cheap. It's actually -- think about it this way. The guesthouse is the flag gets planted immediately at the top of the luxury mountain. So every other luxury hotel in the world is -- I think is going to be forced to tip their hat. And they're going to say like, wow, we've never done that. Wow, how did they figure that out? We're just going to do a lot of things that have never been seen and we're doing it at the very top end of the market. So it's going to be an incredible aspirational, inspiring experience. And it's all designed about privacy and luxury. And I think we're going to command very high rates, and we don't have to sell a lot of rooms because we don't have a lot of rooms. But most boutique hotels are all about they're all trying to be hip and cool and they're trying to have lobbies with a bunch of people sitting in them. And like if you go to -- what's the one I forget now, I'm blanking. But the one you go, you have the Ace Hotels or anything like that, which I think are cool for the market they're going after. But you walk in and -- Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer The original W -- Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, the original W. I think there's all kinds of people sitting in the lobbies and they have their Apple, they have a bunch of little Apple lit up logos, everybody is working, a bunch of unemployed people working on their laptops in the lobby. That's exactly the opposite of what we're going to have. This is about privacy and luxury. Like private entrances, whiff stuff to your room, you don't have to walk by a bunch of people in the lobby. There's no people in the lobby that can like get up the elevator to your room. This is like a whole different gig. And then the F&B experience is super elevated. I mean it's a beautiful, beautiful restaurant with an incredible live-fire component to it. I mean there's no restaurant like it in the world that I've ever seen and we're really excited about the restaurant concept. We're really excited -- New York has been open with our first champagne and caviar cellar, that's going to be an incredible -- I think it's going to be the best experience anybody seeing around caviar and champagne. And it's targeted for very wealthy and affluent and discerning clientele. And the idea is it's going to elevate our brand. It's going to position us as a thought leader, as a tastemaker and a placemaker in the world. And Aspen will do the same. And Aspen will have our first RH Bath House & Spa, and that will have a membership component to it because we only have nine rooms in Aspen, so you can't rent a bath house and spa with nine rooms. But Aspen is going to be a really good model for us with having a membership to a bath house and spa. That will be the nicest spa you can go to in all of Aspen. So you'll get it when you see it. It's really hard -- this is the kind of stuff we do, sometimes seeing is believing. No different than RH Modern. We're first launching that, A lot of people were like, what? What's it going to be? And then we launched it. Now it's a huge part of our business. And same thing with contemporary, same thing with guesthouses, same thing with everything we do. They just haven't been done before. So it's basically, we try to anywhere we can't create new markets, right? So we don't say, oh, let's do it like this person, just a little better. We try to kind of conceptualize something that is significantly better and more unique and desirable than anything that's in the market and we think our guesthouse is going to be that. Operator This concludes today's portion of the Q&A call. I will now turn the call back over to Gary Friedman for closing remarks. Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for your interest in our brand. And I want to thank our team for everything they do to bring our brand to life.
